  "Continue practicing social distancing",
  "Stay away from crowded areas and keep as much distance between nearest neighbors as possible. Those with comorbidities (the elderly,  overweight, immunocompromised, etc.) should be the last to be  reintroduced into society, as they are the most vulnerable. ",
  "Be patient. Don’t reopen too early",
  "Reopening too early runs the risk of triggering exponential growth  again. This might erase all of the benefits gained from the lockdown so  far. It could increase the total amount of deaths, overwhelm the medical  system, and create a scenario where another lockdown is necessary.",
  "Implement contact tracing ",
  "Hiring contact tracers and adopting digital contact tracing technologies will save lives, create jobs, and allow for an earlier return to normalcy. ",
  "Frequently asked questions",
  "What are the classification criteria?",
  "In order to completely contain the virus, new cases per day must go to zero. Green countries are either at that point or very close to it. Yellow countries are those which could reach that point within a reasonable time frame. They still have to get lower to be green. Red countries are either going the wrong way, staying constant, or going down very slowly. ",
  "While some yellow curves might look similar to green curves, comparing the total numbers of new cases per day will often explain the differences in classification.",
  "Why not show cases per capita?",
  "Cases per capita is an important metric. However, when it comes to eliminating the virus, the number of new cases per day must be zero. The fraction of the population that is infected is not what matters. If a country has 100 new cases per day, that provides many routes for the virus to spread. It does not matter whether the population is 1,000,000 or 10,000,000.",
  "Why are all of the peaks the same height?",
  "These plots are adjusted for each country in order to better show the data. The vertical axis is plotted in arbitrary units, in order to easily compare the shapes of the curves. As you can see from the countries which have been successful in fighting COVID-19, it only takes about 5-7 weeks of strong interventions to get rid of the majority of cases. The data show that taking half-measures does not work.",
  "Where is Country x?",
  "This set of countries is certainly not an exhaustive list, but we do highlight the countries which we find to be interesting or important in some way. These lists will be changing over time, and are being updated every few days.",
  "Isn’t much of the confirmed case data inaccurate? Why should I trust this?",
  "While there is some amount of uncertainty in the actual numbers, we argue that those are likely irrelevant to the question of which actions need to be taken. Let’s assume the testing is done in a way in which you only catch 10% of the cases. This would simply scale down the curves by a factor of 10, which would not change the shape of the curves. If there is a sharp increase in the amount of testing vs time, one would expect to see more confirmed cases, even if the actual number of infections is going down. Taking a rolling 7-day average helps reduce the size of the features which show up on timescales of a few days.",
  "Different countries have various amounts of testing. Aren’t large case counts just a result of large amounts of testing?",
  "There are two main factors which influence the total amount of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The first is the total number of infections within the population, the second is the amount of testing being done. It is possible for highly infected regions to show a small number of confirmed cases if their testing is insufficient, which is why the positive testing rate is such an important factor. ",
  "Lockdowns hurt the economy, which in turn can cause many problems. Unemployment, psychological distress, and long-term economic harm need to be considered when deciding how to act. ",
  "This is absolutely true. There are more factors at play here than just the physical health of individuals and communities. ",
  "However, having economic interruptions which last for several weeks is a historically validated response strategy that is as old as history. A short, hard lockdown saves both the economy and the health of the population. If the lockdown is not doing the job very well, and new cases will not slow down, the strategy would be to strengthen the lockdown, rather than lift it. ",
  "The price a country pays for reopening too early can be incredibly high. Massive amounts of deaths, a collapsed healthcare system, and having multiple lockdowns would cause massive amounts of damage, and must be avoided.",

Such ephemeral community alliances, might explain the spread of COVID during certain time periods. Despite ephemeral inclusions or exclusions, during the majority of the weeks, maps show north-east (purple), south-east (blue), south (pink), mid-west (grey), and the west (yellow-brown).

Currently, the standard for early detection of COVID-19 infections is limited to RT-PCR tests, and results can be slow and unreliable. CT scans with high detection capabilities have the potential to increase testing access, disease monitoring, and identification of early and asymptomatic cases. To dramatically accelerate the development and use of clinical protocols for COVID-19 management and increase the availability, ease, and accuracy of diagnoses, The XPRIZE Pandemic Alliance, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Open-QIC COVID Registry, the ",
  " network, and the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI) have joined forces to launch the COVID-19 CT Scan Collaborative.",

  "CT-SCAN CHALLENGE",
  "Recent reports demonstrate the utility of thoracic CT scanning as a reliable and efficacious detection method for COVID-19. CT scans also have been found to be useful for identifying asymptomatic cases and for monitoring and predicting disease progression. Due to the recency and novelty of the pandemic, however, objective information about the performance characteristics of thoracic CT scanning is limited. A critical aspect of CT performance is the reliability of readings, which will need to be demonstrated as part of its application.",
  "The process of guaranteeing reliability of clinical protocols including radiological detection requires thorough coordination between radiology and other medical disciplines to validate consistencies, standardize detection algorithms, and establish widespread clinical protocols. Such lengthy processes, routinely taking years, are ill-suited for the current health crisis. Rapid processing of, and consistency in, CT imaging reading are necessary to accelerate the reputation of this approach as the gold standard in detecting COVID-19.",
  "To dramatically accelerate the utilization of CT scans, we can implement a system that performs multiple readings in real time sufficient to determine standards-specific detection questions with accepted reliability. This process can be designed so that clinical protocols including, for example, specified structured detection questions (CO-RAD), will evolve in response to feedback about its utilization in detection and care management of patients, progressively validating them and improving them. Such a system may be generalized in the future for accelerating advances in care for other conditions.",

  "COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of confirmed cases to require extended hospitalizations and roughly 2-4% of confirmed cases result in death, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing, or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the likelihood of transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also so that they don’t transmit the disease to others.",
  "If everyone got tested for COVID-19, we could temporarily separate the infected from the uninfected. This would help reduce the spread of the virus and allow for societies to function normally. For these reasons, universal testing is our highest priority.",

  "Fig. 1. County status in Ireland including five levels of zone distinction, by number of cases in the past 14 days, on July 12, 2020. Three counties have no cases in the last 14 days but don’t qualify for green zone status because of neighboring red zones, i.e. they are yellow zones.",
  "A Green Zone strategy, one that selectively imposes restrictions within a country, e.g. at county level, is the optimal strategy to rapidly reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and accelerate the return to normal social, health, education, and business activity—as each county, province or state becomes clear—without disease and loss of life.",
  "This approach has already been used effectively, but often not completely, in multiple countries, including Ireland, New Zealand, China, Switzerland, and Argentina. Many European countries are now applying Green Zone style approaches, both to allow for response to localized outbreaks and for selective easing of restrictions on travel to neighbouring countries with similar or lower disease rates. Countries that imposed restrictions on non-essential travel, both internationally and between localities within their borders, have achieved very rapid contraction of their epidemics and local, or even national, elimination of the disease. This enabled them to reopen economic activity in most of the affected area within a few weeks, while the most stringent control measures were selectively maintained only in areas with ongoing community transmission (Red Zones).",
  "Right now, Ireland can achieve safety, with consistently normal local activity in many counties, with perhaps the occasional need for more intensive local responses to local outbreaks. To do this, a key policy is a more consistent Green Zone strategy, using international and inter-county travel restrictions to prevent and control larger outbreaks. This will serve as a foundation for a return to comparatively normal domestic economic activities and social life. Partnering with other Green Zone countries will enable international travel, fostering a broader effort to get to zero.",

  "Introduction",
  "It is often claimed that there is a trade-off between containing COVID-19 and minimizing disruption to the economy, and that eliminating COVID-19 (by which we mean getting to no community transmission—i.e. no cases from unknown sources) is too costly to be worthwhile. Here, we examine the validity of these claims. ",
  "We consider a space of policy action in which a country (or state) decreases its number of cases per day by reducing the reproductive number R below 1 for a duration of its choosing and then maintains thereafter a constant number of cases per day. The question is what is the right level at which to maintain this constant number of cases per day. The essential idea is that there are two strategies: 1) an elimination strategy in which R < 1 is maintained until there is no more community transmission and after which the country reopens (save for targeted responses in specific locations to combat cases that are imported), and 2) a steady-state strategy, in which R < 1 is maintained for some period of time but not long enough to eliminate community transmission and after which R = 1 is maintained nationwide. ",
  "The elimination strategy requires a greater upfront cost, since R < 1 is maintained for a longer duration, but requires lower costs thereafter since economic activity in the country can largely return to normal, with the exception of targeted measures in specific locations in the event of a second outbreak caused by an imported case. The steady-state strategy, on the other hand, requires the costly maintenance of R = 1 nationwide in order for cases not to rise; if community transmission is not eliminated and R = 1 is not maintained, a second wave will occur sooner or later, as has already occurred in many countries that have not yet chosen the elimination strategy. Because of the long time during which a country must maintain R = 1 under the steady-state strategy, it is worthwhile even from a purely economic perspective for a country in almost all cases to instead choose the elimination strategy, despite its greater short-term costs.",
  "The IFR of the Diamond Princess has been Misreported, Best Current Value is 2.0%",

  "Abstract",
  "The COVID-19 cases on the Diamond Princess have served as an important case study for analysis of the outbreak. Here we show that the reported IFR and its subsequent use in the widely quoted study and meta-analysis that incorporates it have fundamental errors. This includes not updating for subsequent deaths and use of an extrapolated correction of Chinese data rather than the actual Diamond Princess data. Instead of a value of 0.6% these corrections would lead to an IFR of 2.0%, though even this number is unjustified by multiple manifestly invalid assumptions.",
  "Recently, the US CDC updated its guidelines on epidemiological parameters of COVID-19[1]. In this new version, the CDC replaced CFR (fatality rate among all confirmed cases) with IFR (fatality rate among all infections) as the dimension to measure severity. The CDC gave the current estimate of 0.65% IFR, based on the work of Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz and Lea Merone [2], referred to as MKM in the following. MKM examined publications on the topic up to 16/06/2020. 24 IFR estimations are included. We have found multiple issues with these estimates. This is the first of a series of reports to clarify the IFR calculations. In this report we focus on one of the 24: Estimating the infection and case fatality ratio for COVID-19 using age-adjusted data from the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship[3], referred to as DP in the following. There are three major problems in how MKM used this study and the study itself. ",
  "1) The 1.2% IFR from Diamond Princess data was calculated based on early data. The deaths doubled after the publication of the study. ",
  "2) MKM did not actually use the 1.2% IFR calculated for Diamond Princess, as they claimed in their primary table on prior results, instead using an extrapolated 0.6% IFR for China based upon multiple questionable logic steps. These steps invalidate the inference and violate meta analysis principles of sampling experimental results. ",
  "3) The Diamond Princess paper adjusted the China CFR with the Diamond Princess CFR obtained from a very small statistical sample of only 7 deaths, and has many unjustified assumptions unaddressed. ",
  "In summary, rather than a 0.6% IFR value, a value that might be used in a meta analysis from DP would be 2.0% based upon the data from the Diamond Princess. Even this value is suspect given remarkably poor statistics, and other inconsistencies in data interpretation to be detailed below.",
  "Fig. 1: Logical flow chart of [3]. Blue and turquoise shaded squares are two empirical data values the study cites. Rounded squares are logic steps in the paper connecting from the empirical values to the conclusions. The red arrows are problematic logic steps",
  "We map the logic steps of DP in Fig. 1. The study collected the infection data on Diamond Princess up to Feb. 20 [4], [5] and the infection outcome by Mar 3. It calculated a \"corrected CFR (cCFR)\" of the cruise. The term \"corrected CFR\" as contrasted to a \"naive CFR (nCFR)\" indicates it is not the direct ratio of deaths to confirmed cases at a particular time point, but considers the delay in \"confirmation-to-death\". This adjustment is justified as nCFR tends to underestimate the severity of an epidemic (especially at the beginning) because some of the current confirmed cases will lead to deaths that are unaccounted for in the calculation of nCFR. We summarize various relevant values in MKM and DP in Table 1.",
  "Table. 1: Values used in MKM and DP, official reports are as of Aug. 4, 2020.",
  "DP also calculated the ratio of symptomatic to infected individuals α as 49% on the cruise based on a Japanese government report[5], However, the government report uses the term \"asymptomatic\" differently from the literature, and indeed differently from what would be needed to calculate an IFR. It includes in its definition of asymptomatic \"(A) an individual who developed mild or unnoticeable symptoms and self-identified as asymptomatic\" and \"(C) an individual with recent infection who has not yet developed symptoms and was identified by test before symptom onset\"[5]. (A) depends on self-reporting and includes mild symptoms, and (C) should be classified as \"presymptomatic.\" Both mild and presymptomatic cases should be included in symptomatic cases. This means asymptomatic case counts are overestimated, hence α is underestimated. Significantly, there is no conclusion that can be drawn about α from this data except that it is the lower bound of α for the Diamond Princess, whereas the true value of alpha from this population is unknown. ",
  "DP then cites the data from [6] which indicates that the China nCFR (up to Feb.11) is 2.3%, with the 70-79 y/o group at 8.0%, and the 80+ y/o group at 14.8%. DP applied the age-stratified nCFR to the Diamond Princess population, calculating that 15.15 deaths are expected. Comparing to the 7 deaths observed by Mar 3, the authors concluded",
  "(step A1 and A2 in in Fig. 1).",
  "In order for such a correction to be justified: ",
  "(1) the proportion of over 80 y/o in the Chinese population must be equal to the proportion in the Diamond Cruise, ",
  "(2) there must not be other factors that lead to differences in the age-stratified fatality rates between the two populations. ",
  "The China study has 3% of patients ≥ 80 y/o [6], while the Diamond Princess has 9.6% of symptomatic cases (8.7% of all infections) ≥ 80 y/o [3]. The much larger proportion combined with an increasing CFR with age indicates that any assumption of corresponding fatality rates is unjustified. Given this breakdown of the assumptions, it is apparent that the cruise members over 80 y/o do not have the same vulnerability as members of the Chinese population over 80 y/o, reasonably including infirmities and disabilities that would prevent an individual from going on a cruise. An 80 y/o on a cruise, unsurprisingly, may not be representative of an 80 y/o in the general population. The discrepancy may also be due to the small sample of individuals on the cruise. So multiplying the China nCFR by 46% to obtain a 1.1% \"cCFR\" is incorrect. Moreover, this observation of population distinctions also invalidates the study use as a means of estimating the mortality rate of the population as a whole. ",
  "The study then multiplies this cCFR by α to obtain the cIFR of China (step B1 and B2 in Fig. 1). Once again, this assumes the China patient cohort has a similar α to that of the cruise. While DP failed to provide evidence for this assumption, the study it cites[6] noted 889 asymptomatic cases and 44672 confirmed symptomatic cases, indicating an α of 98%, doubling that of the cruise. The discrepancy provides evidence against the calculation in DP. Regardless of the actual value, given that the α of the cruise is underestimated by incorrect reporting of the asymptomatic cases, it is also incorrect as an estimate of α in China. As a result, the 0.5% cIFR obtained is an underestimate because both cCFR and α of China are underestimated. ",
  "Moreover, the two main quantities providing empirical evidence from which the authors constructed the calculation are both out of date. For the Diamond Princess, by Apr 14, 14 of the 696 cases died [7], doubling the deaths observed by Mar 3. For China, by July 21, 4634 of the 83707 symptomatic cases died [8], resulting in a 5.5% nCFR, more than doubling the nCFR observed by Feb. 11. We also note, the current China nCFR is very close to the cCFR, because the remaining active cases (the upper limit of potential uncounted deaths) are relatively small compared to cumulative deaths. ",
  "In addition, DP claimed 6 out of the first 7 death cases were patients in their 70s and 1 in their 80s (Table 2 [3]), while the Japanese government reported 4 in their 80s, 2 in their 70s, and one unspecified [9]. This manifest discrepancy has no available explanation. ",
  "In Fig. 2, we plot the value of the CFR measured in three ways. The denominators are labeled ",
  "(a) nCFR: all symptomatic cases, ",
  "(b) CFR by outcome: all symptomatic cases that have a clinical outcome, and ",
  "(c) CFR by delay: all symptomatic cases confirmed by 14 days prior. ",
  "We see the three CFR lines converge after Apr. 17 to around 5.5%. Therefore, both CFRs cited in the cruise study are gross underestimations due to the use of values from early time estimates. ",
  "According to our analysis, [3] has flaws in the empirical data it relies upon, whose definitions do not correspond to the way they are being used in calculations, and in its assumptions and conclusions. The inclusion of this study in MKM is questionable at best. Yet more strikingly, MKM uses this study not for its calculated 1.2% cIFR for the Diamond Princess (which would be appropriate for a meta-analysis of multiple empirical data sources), but rather for the extrapolated 0.6% cIFR for China. This is true even though all of the calculations in DP are based upon data for Diamond Princess. MKM actually annotated this study as \"IFR was 1.3%\" in Table 1[2], but incorporated it as 0.6% (Figure 1-4). We find it all the more remarkable that despite all of these errors, the CDC quotes the 0.65% IFR solely based on this meta-analysis. Needless to say, we would expect a higher standard for science in general, and for an ongoing pandemic analysis in particular. We have also found there are problems in other studies included in MKM, which will be addressed in additional reports.",
  "Fig. 2: New cases, fatalities, and CFRs of China (7 day averages). Three ways to calculate: solid line (nCFR) is death cases divided by all symptomatic cases. Dashed line is death cases divided by all symptomatic cases that have a clinical outcome (recover or death). Dot-dashed line is death cases by all symptomatic cases confirmed 14 days ago. ",

  "Context",
  "Long-term care institutions, nursing homes, care homes, assisted living and retirement homes are high-risk institutions for disease transmission because residents are vulnerable due to their health status and their close proximity to one another. COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease requiring hospitalization in about 6% of cases and resulting in death in 2-10% of cases in these high-risk settings. Complications further increase for persons 70 years old and above with pre-existing comorbidities especially heart failure, diabetes and hypertension. COVID-19 can transmit with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing or elevated temperature) and even through asymptomatic persons unaware that they are infected. Reducing the likelihood of transmission is imperative in high-risk institutional environments as has been clearly shown initially in China and subsequently in European and American outbreaks.",
  "Although the number of deaths from COVID-19 in care homes varies between and within countries, the percentage of COVID-related deaths in care homes worldwide range from 24% to 82% [4]. This policy snapshot looks at what countries have done to protect care homes during the COVID-19 crisis, including providing guidance, strengthening medical support, testing for residents and staff, and other supportive measures. ",
  "In the last four months, the medical and scientific communities and the Endcoronvirus.org team have examined measures different countries have taken to protecting care homes. ",
  "The data we have obtained is consistent with basic principles on how to achieve robust prevention and risk reduction. In order to continue to improve, it is important to identify approaches that have led to better outcomes and to draw out learning for the ongoing and future outbreaks. Prevention and control systems and emergency plans should be developed. Strict management of movement in and out of centers, health monitoring for early detection of COVID-19 cases and quarantine and segmentation plans have shown to be important. In addition, studies found that caregivers working in multiple facilities leads to more cases and higher death rates (notably see [5]). ",
  "Here are recommended guidelines for prevention by introducing barriers to transmission from outside a facility, managing internal processes and helping the workforce to care for and protect residents. Developing guidelines is an ongoing effort, we summarise the main suggested strategies to deploy and highlight key items to take into account as of today. ",
  "The document is divided into sections. Section 1 covers rules for visitors, testing and outbreak monitoring, hygiene, dining and other high contact activities, employees and corporate environment, air quality and records. Section 2 covers enhanced rules for areas of active transmission regarding visitors and testing, dining and other high contact activities as well as employees, facilities and corporate environment. Section 3 lists a series of measures taken in some states and countries leading to distinct success in protecting care homes residents. Appendices cover A) employee safety and screening questions, B) Personal protective equipment (PPE), C) Definitions of COVID-19 cases and contacts, D) Isolation of confirmed, suspected or symptomatic residents, E) Receiving residents being discharged from hospital and F) Decontamination and cleaning processes for care homes with possible or confirmed cases.",
  "In order to respond in a timely way to the COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk Institutions, it is important to enhance risk control strategically, as well as strengthen daily prevention and control measures such as personnel protection, environmental cleaning, and disinfection.

  "Testing and Outbreak Monitoring Strategies ",
  "Pooled testing for residents and staff: If possible, implement a preemptive testing program using frequent individual screening or pooled testing, to identify cases early & better control spread from asymptomatic & pre-symptomatic cases. ",
  "Targeted regular sampling of highly connected individuals: Identify individuals who are at risk for contracting the disease or for transmitting the disease because they are highly connected due to ongoing contact with multiple individuals in the population and regularly test them. ",
  "Self-reporting and diagnosis: In this way of testing, an individual first has to identify they have symptoms that require medical care, and then report to a physician who performs a diagnosis, and if the diagnosis determines that they have this particular disease (with some false positives and negatives) the individual is isolated. ",
  "Contact tracing including visitors if relevant: Individuals who have been in contact with a diagnosed individual (according to the self-reporting and diagnosis method, or from clinical diagnostic testing) are identified and are contacted to either be on the lookout for symptoms or directly to be isolated. Even if they are not infected, their isolation (including many people who are not actually infected, i.e. false positives) is used to stop the outbreak. (see APPENDIX C: Definitions of COVID-19 cases and contacts) ",
  "Targeted random sampling of staff and residents: In a regular (non-active) setting this way of testing, diagnostic or tests (DNA tests, qRT-PCR tests or possibly viral RNA tests or even the use of regular screening with pulse-ox meters where possible) as a further aid), are applied to individuals of high risk populations, for example, in confined communities such as nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, psychiatric wards, medical facilities, or retirement communities. In those locations when one individual is infected many individuals are likely to be infected even if they are not yet showing symptoms or would have positive test results. In that case, the entire community can be isolated as individuals. ",
  "Mass Screening: Systematic tests of everyone in a facility are recommended if a few cases are identified, or one case without clear prior cause or existing quarantine. Cases happen in clusters and testing everyone can expose multiple presymptomatic or asymptomatic cases whose isolation will prevent a much larger outbreak. ",
  "Hygiene ",
  "Increased cleaning and sanitizing of all high-frequency touchpoints at a pace compatible with the usage.

  "As soon as there are signs of an outbreak, the facility must provide masks (if possible N95) and they may be required even before outbreak confirmation. ",
  "Deliveries should be made by single drivers who do not have symptoms of the disease and have not recently (within 14-21 days) had known exposures. ",
  "Whenever possible, no-contact deliveries should be dropped off in a space that does not require entry into the facility. ",
  "It is highly advisable that people allowed entrance into a high-risk institutional environment have been recently tested with negative results. ",
  "Have a designated area for visiting; that area would be used only for necessary visits, as previously defined. Ideally this area should have direct access (not pass by various parts of the facility) & should be cleaned & ventilated as often as possible (ideally after each visit).",
  "Testing ",
  "Systematic and specific testing: If possible, DNA tests, qRT-PCR tests or possibly viral RNA tests or even the use of regular screening with pulse-ox meters where possible or other specific tests, should be applied widely and regularly (e.g. weekly, or every X days, etc.) to the workforce to identify and isolate individuals who are infected. This way of testing focuses on a specific facility or area, in order to identify potential cases to be isolated. If the test is specific enough and can be applied widely enough, this approach can stop an outbreak. ",
  "CAUTION: COVID RT-PCR tests have a sampling induced false negative rates. Multiple tests are often needed to confirm a diagnosis. The false negative rates of RT-PCR may give false confidence to individuals who are sick to continue normal activities. Symptomatic individuals should not be considered to be COVID free even if they have negative test results. Therefore, RT-PCR tests cannot be relied upon by themselves for transmission prevention. Resolution of symptoms and multiple negative tests are necessary. ",
  "Where RT-PCR test results are delayed, or for members of high risk institutions, or where isolation or workforce decisions must be made, CT-scans with lower false negative rates are better suited to ruling out a COVID diagnosis. ",
  "Where persistent widespread testing within institutions is not possible due to resources or costs, pool testing can be used. Pool testing may be exploited in an optimal strategy, as an alternative to alleviate test availability or other limitations while still giving relevant information and controls. Since pool testing has its own issues with respect to false positive v. false negative rate, it should be used as a preliminary measure that is upgraded as soon as is feasible. ",
  "Typically, the most important difficulty is false-negatives because of the initial self-reporting: people who are sick, but do not recognize it and don’t self-report, perhaps because symptoms are generic/nonspecific, or immediately life-threatening, or because of false negative test results. Asymptomatics also represent a major risk factor in care homes. Alternatively, individuals may suspect they have the disease but for personal, financial, social or professional reasons don’t choose to be diagnosed, or are not provided with the opportunity to be diagnosed, and isolated. Systematic testing minimizes the risk of both mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic being missed in the process and removes many social and professional reasons to avoid testing. ",
  "Where effective contact tracing is operational, high-risk asymptomatic persons can be directed to present for testing, quarantined, or at a minimum explicitly discouraged or barred from visiting or working in the facility depending on local jurisdictions. ",
  "Employees, Facilities And Corporate Environment ",
  "Emphasize to employees that their actions outside of work can lead to transmission of infection risking the lives of residents. Education should include how to mitigate risk to their families and households as well as to residents of the facilities where they work. Even if the disease has a low risk to them, any contact with individuals or surfaces in non-safe areas is extremely dangerous for those in the high-risk facility. They should take responsibility and limit off-work non-safe contact to a minimum, while their employers/facilities are making face coverings and/or masks available to their close relatives. ",

This should not be considered to be the isolation period for an infected individual. The infectious period and the duration of the disease vary widely and are often much longer than 14 days. Even after apparent recovery from the disease, viral shedding causing infections of others may continue. The total infectious period includes a few days prior to symptoms, the symptomatic period, and the post-symptomatic infectious period.

  "However, systematic inactivation on a variety of fomites and conditions is not yet well understood. This includes its dependence on the quantity of viral deposits, temperature, humidity, and other ambient conditions. For high density or large areas, the reliability of inactivation decreases and chemical disinfection is highly recommended. Washing and the use of disinfectants also should allow time for the effects to occur. Applying disinfectant and leaving on surfaces before rinsing is important. ",

  "A Homeschool Pod is a way to share in responsibilities, joys and interactions with others safely. In order to do so, the Members have to be safe themselves and take responsibility for each other's safety. Before creating a Homeschool Pod, it is important to get together and work on safety guidelines every Pod member agrees to follow. Contact between people increases the risk of infection, so stronger precautions are needed in order to allow for contact without introducing risks that will certainly lead to infection over time. Therefore, Homeschool Pods are only for families who:",
  " 1. Already have created an environment for themselves that have a very low chance of infection",
  "AND",
  "2.   Work even harder on their own safety for the sake of the safety of other Pod Members",
  "Homeschool Pods are about sharing safety, not sharing risk. Shared guidelines should reflect this. There are at least 5 dimensions along which can be thought to address these points:",
  "How can my family act safer in everyday life?",
  "1. Behavioral dimension outside the Pod",
  "Do we live in an area that is recording a surge in new cases?",
  "2. Ambient dimension",
  "Is it really necessary to pod up?",
  "3. Dimension of urgency",
  "How can we help one another?",
  "4. Behavioral dimension within Pods",
  "How strong is our commitment to safety?",
  "5. Dimension of the imperative to safety",
  "Consequently, it is expected that the following model of Homeschool Pod Guidelines serves only as an inspiration that is not just copied and laxly agreed on. We strongly encourage each group to develop their own guidelines. This model is an example of some that have worked for us these past few months.",
  "Vision",
  "This project was partly inspired by the concepts of COVID-safe spaces[1] and green zones[2]. Creating Homeschool Pods is the attempt to establish small “green” networks between families. ",
  "It is not possible for a zone to become green unless bordering zones did not record new COVID-19 cases within the last 14 days, too. Therefore, it is up to all neighboring communities to help each other eliminate the virus.  In the same spirit, Homeschool Pods should try everything to galvanize their communities to become green zones. The solution cannot be to do nothing; we need to start somewhere and build green networks and zones, step by step.",
  "It is recognized that joining a Homeschool Pod will not be possible for everybody for financial, time and/or safety reasons. Additionally, there will be differences in how difficult it is to eliminate the virus from communities as well as to keep them safe afterwards. Known inherent inequities in our system will likely become more visible, disproportionately affecting minorities and marginalized groups, as well as BIPOC families.",
  "We hope to encourage people to join us in our efforts beyond this document to support anyone who wants to be in a Pod, to provide each Pod with equal access to quality educational resources, to help every community end COVID-19 for good and to mitigate any potential long-term harm caused by creating Homeschool Pods. ",
  "What is a Homeschool Pod?",
  " A Homeschool Pod is a small group of families who want to come together in a thoughtful way during the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate community and peer connections for their children which are fundamental to their development and growth. ",
  "While community and peer to peer connection are essential, the health and wellness of everyone is of the utmost importance during the current pandemic. It is understood that forming a Homeschool Pod and sharing resources equitably poses fundamental challenges at this unprecedented moment. This model is committed to finding solutions to these complex problems by inviting the voices of every community to engage in conversation. ",
  "While the safest option is to engage in regular virtual interactions, the purpose of this document is to discuss how to think about the option of physical meetings. Once Pods form, the Pod becomes a social unit that shares safety and risk together. ",
  "Depending on specific life conditions, needs and preferences, it is recommended that individual Pod families determine factors in their lives that lead to risk of infection before connecting with other families and planning meetings and creating any shared rules the Pod may follow to promote safety. For this to work, a Homeschool Pod is based on trust and transparency among all Pod Members as well as the willingness to learn and hold each other accountable. ",
  "Any social gathering--even with strict measures in place-- raises the risk of contracting or transmitting COVID-19. Any one person becoming infected is likely to cause other Members of the Pod to become infected as well. All Pod Families join a Homeschool Pod with this understanding and should take actions to reduce their risks so that they and the other Members of the Pod can be safe. ",
  "The level of safety also depends critically on current conditions of transmission in the community. High levels of transmission increase the need for stricter safety measures and limit Pod formation. This is due to an increased chance of coming in contact with rare cases that can be asymptomatic for an extended period of time. ",
  "General Remarks",
  "Pods are based on trust and transparency.  In order for the Homeschool Pods to be successful, Pod Members should be honest about their daily activities outside the Pod. Decisions made by a single Pod family member that break the contract of their shared community agreed-upon safety precautions can result in fatal or permanently damaging illness spreading through all families within the group.",
  "As an outbreak progresses, hard decisions will inevitably arise over whether a family should leave the Homeschool Pod in order to help family and friends not connected to the Pod (such as to care for elderly relatives). Families should be prepared to make these decisions.",
  "Pod Families may face life circumstances that require them to shift to a Pod with a different COVID-19 level of risk.  Pod Families should be prepared to discuss whether the Pod as a whole will shift to a different level of risk or just the specific family. If only the family shifts to a different Pod level, they should recognize that there may be quarantine requirements or other rules to follow before officially joining the new Pod. ",
  "It is possible that Pod Members may make poor choices or actions inside and outside the Pod (i.e., forgetting to wear a face covering when you go out for a walk).  Since any one act can increase the possibility of infection, it is important that all Pod Members make a concerted effort to recognize errors and aim to minimize or eliminate future mistakes. Ensuring that lessons are learned is more important than accusation, blame or punishment. However, when multiple (e.g., repeatedly socializing without a face covering) or severe mistakes (e.g., attending a potential superspreader event) are made, the Pod should be prepared to handle a situation where a Pod member engages in high risk, high consequence behavior.  ",
  "Suggestions for Pod Formation",
  "A family participating in a Homeschool Pod will be referred to as a “Pod Family.” This includes ",
  " If Homeschool Pods consist of more than 2 families the risk of infection increases with every added family and trust and transparency become more difficult to establish over a long period of time.",
  "all people or pets sharing a household with the Pod Members, even if they do not participate in Pod meetups (i.e, a working spouse). Household Members will occasionally be called “Pod Family Members” within this document. ",
  "It is recommended that Pod Families establish an understanding with one another, either through written guidelines or some other agreed-upon method, that clearly outlines any lifestyle adjustments that may be necessary before the first in-person Homeschool Pod gathering (e.g., all families must quarantine for 14 days prior to the first Pod meet-up). ",
  "COVID-19 Levels of Risk",
  "Provided below are three COVID-19 levels of risk that can help define each Homeschool Pod.  Each level of risk represents a group of families who face different challenges while navigating their daily lives outside the Pod during the current COVID-19 pandemic.  ",
  "The Low level of risk is defined as a Pod with families who participate in very low risk activities outside the Pod (see chart below for specific examples).",
  "Any Pod family with an individual belonging to the vulnerable population (e.g., an elderly parent who requires care inside or outside of the family) should only pair up with other families on the low risk level, or perhaps not join a Pod at all for the health and safety of that vulnerable family member.  Any activities a specific Pod decides to pursue as a group may increase the risk of that Pod (e.g., attending educational activities within an enclosed public space with strong COVID-safety measures). Some activities (e.g., going to enclosed places with no COVID-safety measures) do not fall in any category because they are not considered to be in line with the idea of sharing safety in Pods and are thus not acceptable in Homeschool Pods. The reason is that if an individual is at a high level of risk of being infected, joining a Pod will almost surely lead to additional infections. This is just like healthcare providers at high risk choosing to stay away from their family members while treating patients.  Other activities might require Pod Members to go above and beyond what other people do to stay at least in the moderate risk category (e.g., wearing eye-protection in addition to other measures when shopping inside a store).",
  "Risk to COVID-19 virus exposure increases with each level of risk. ",
  "  ",
  "IMPORTANT: All Pod Members, regardless of COVID-19 risk levels, recognize that participating in a Homeschool Pod does not mean there is no risk of contracting COVID-19. Pod Family Members who are asymptomatic with COVID-19 may unknowingly transmit the virus to the rest of the Pod. Families creating a Homeschool Pod should recognize that they have the responsibility for evaluating the risks they are taking and do so at their own risk.",
  "Risk  Levels-- What needs do families have outside of their Pod meetups?",
  " For families who have one or more Pod Members required to be in high risk COVID-19 enclosed spaces (such as hospitals or nursing homes) or travel by public transportation, it is not recommended to have in-person meet ups. Communities are encouraged to help these families create and fund the best possible virtual solutions that meet their needs for connection and learning.",
  "A Note for families with Pod Members who work in high risk COVID-19 environments or find it necessary to take Mass Transit.",
  "After determining their risk category, it is then suggested that Pod Families decide and agree upon any additional rules or guidelines that will regulate their specific Pod. For example: ",
  " At work or in enclosed spaces, at all times:",
  "Wearing of face coverings",
  "Social distancing of at least 6 ft",
  "Handwashing / hand sanitizer",
  "Ensuring good airflow (open windows or air purifiers)",
  "No touching of frequently used surfaces",
  "No touching the face",
  "Wearing of eye protection",
  "No long interaction (< 5 min with non-Pod Members (especially if uncovered))",
  "Outside, at all times:",
  "No long interaction (< 5 min with non-Pod Members (especially if unmasked))",
  "Upon returning home from any indoor or outdoor activities:",
  "Decontaminating shoes or keeping them outside the living area",
  "Washing clothes or putting them aside for outside use only",
  "Showering (potential exceptions: bringing the trash out, etc., then Handwashing)",

  "No unnecessary entering of indoor places",
  "By foot, bike or car only",
  "In certain cases, a Pod Family could be faced with a situation where they cannot follow their Pod’s specific measures (such as if a family member is hospitalized or a Pod Family Member assumes a caregiver role to an extended non-Pod family member). In this situation, it is highly recommended that the Pod Family agrees to quarantine from the rest of their Pod for a minimum of 14 days after their situation resolves, and follow all of their Pod guidelines before rejoining the Pod.",
  "In Between Risk Categories? ",
  "Shifting to a different level of risk may be uncomfortable, frustrating or confusing in these very unusual times. Lifestyle adjustments are likely to be necessary, however, to help your Homeschool Pod be a success for all participating Pod Families. With that in mind:",
  "If families think they are between risk levels, perhaps they can form a Pod in which every member agrees to follow laid-out guidelines for their specific combination of categories.",
  "For families who think they are at a level of risk that exceeds Moderate Risk and/or find themselves with many exceptions to the guidelines outlined above, and cannot or choose not to adjust their lifestyle accordingly, it is strongly recommended that these families consider homeschooling on their own following CDC guidelines to the best of their ability, until the following occurs: ",
  "The family’s residential area/town/city is designated a Green Zone, which is defined as:",
  "No community transmission within the last 14 days in this zone",
  "No community transmission within the last 14 days in a directly adjacent zone",
  "Effective testing and contact tracing ",
  "Travel restrictions from zones with community transmission  ",
  "A vaccine is developed that is proven to be reliable and safe and is administered on such a large scale that it reduces or eliminates transmission of COVID-19",
  "Other scientific, verifiable proof that the virus is no longer a threat",
  "Meetups",
  "If at least one member of a Pod Family gets sick with COVID-19-like symptoms such as those listed below AND has potentially exposed other families in the Pod, it is highly recommended that the entire Pod agrees to quarantine for at least 14 days and pivot to virtual meetings and resources. Each Homeschool Pod decides when it is safe to reconvene in-person (i.e., once ALL families in that Pod are symptom-free for 14 days.)",

  "At least one Pod Family Member has interacted directly with someone within the last 14 days who has tested positive for COVID-19 infection.",
  "It is highly recommended that all Pod Families create a questionnaire specific to their Pod’s COVID-19 risk level to help hold themselves accountable for the safety of their family and the rest of the Homeschool Pod. Ideally this would be a screening tool to help families decide if they should skip or attend a meet up. Families can use their own specific guidelines to make a questionnaire or find one online that comes close to their community agreements. The Pod needs to agree on how to handle situations where a family realizes that something may have changed or could be of significance to the rest of their Pod.",

  "In general, the safer the Pods are, the more physically they can get together during programming and other meetups,",
  "Note that bathrooms are a locus of transmission so either returning home might be necessary or special arrangements must be made for bathroom use. ",
  "An Example",
  "The Benson Family wants to be part of a Homeschool Pod. One parent works remotely while the other parent homeschools the children full-time. When they go shopping once every 10 days, they enter a grocery store rather than get deliveries for financial reasons. They always enter a grocery store with strict COVID-safety measures. They find themselves in the Level 2 - Moderate - Low category.",
  "However, to minimize risk, they would prefer to pod up only with families that can fully work remotely, so they determine that they are actually between the Low and Moderate-Low Risk categories, with some additional exceptions to the recommendations: They wear face coverings and practice social distancing in enclosed and outdoor spaces, but don’t want to do this when it comes to meetups with Pod Members.",
  "They want to trust the other families in the Pod so that their children can interact with other children in the Pod without face coverings or social distancing. They find two other families with the same preferences, and they all agree to form a Pod together and write their Pod agreement to their very specific guidelines, which are a combination of both Low and Moderate-Low Risk categories. ",
  "DISCLAIMER",
  "Even if all recommendations outlined here are followed by all Members of a Pod, they may only mitigate but never completely eliminate the risk of infection--plus possible serious or fatal consequences. All Pod Members join a Homeschool Pod with the full understanding and acknowledgment of the Homeschool Pod recommendations set forth in this document and agree to create a Homeschool Pod, with their own ideas and rules, at their own risk. It is highly recommended to collectively agree in writing on the specific guidelines any Pod will follow. ",

  "July 8, 2020 ",
  "Travel restrictions are an important tool for the reduction of inter-community disease transmission. By restricting travel between geographic regions, communities reduce the chances of undermining disease containment by importing infected cases. Here we look at some of the travel restriction measures taken by New Zealand, Luxembourg, Ireland, France and Spain to mitigate the risk of disease transmission. ",
  "I. NEW ZEALAND ",
  "New Zealand has performed comparably well during the COVID-19 outbreak. As an island nation, travel could be limited in a simpler way than for countries with land borders. On May 13, 2020 the New Zealand COVID-19 Alert Levels were published. Four alert levels were created based on disease outbreak conditions: ",
  "1) Level 1 - Prepare: COVID-19 is controlled overseas; Isolated household transmission could be occurring in New Zealand ",
  "2) Level 2 - Reduce: Household transmission could be occurring; Single or isolated cluster outbreaks ",
  "3) Level 3 - Restrict: Community transmission might be happening; New clusters may emerge but can be controlled through testing and contact tracing ",
  "4) Level 4 - Lockdown: Community transmission is occurring; Widespread outbreaks and new clusters ",
  "A mandatory quarantine or managed isolation of 14 days is required of all travelers entering New Zealand before onward domestic travel. Domestic travel restrictions depend on alert level. At an alert level of 1 people are encouraged to avoid mass transit if they are feeling sick, waiting for test results or required to self-isolate. At an alert level of 2 people who are sick are not allowed to use mass transit. Other travelers on mass transit are encouraged to practice social distancing and other risk mitigating measures. At an alert level of 3 travel between within country regions is only allowed for limited essential travel. Workers may only work as far as a neighboring region. At an alert level of four travel between regions and within regions is banned except for certain essential travel. ",
  "Restrictions at the different alert levels are cumulative. There are no restrictions on freight regardless of alert level. A comprehensive table of New Zealand’s COVID-19 measures can be found at: ",
  "https://covid19.govt.nz/assets/resources/ tables/COVID-19-alert-levels-detailed.pdf",
  "Plans have been developed for starting travel in a TransTasman bubble to allow non-quarantine travel between Australia and New Zealand. However infected travelers arriving in New Zealand at the end of June, and outbreaks in Australia at the beginning of July have postponed this project. ",
  "On June 16, 2020, after 24 consecutive days of no new cases in the country, two new cases were confirmed - the result of recent travel from abroad. Two travelers were allowed to arrive from the UK after the death of a relative. They were granted compassionate exemption to break the mandatory 14 managed isolation on arrival in order to travel from Aukland to Wellington via private vehicle. They are thought to have had no contact with anyone during the trip according to New Zealand’s Director-General of Health. Authorities tested, traced and isolated anyone who came in contact with the infected individuals. Plans for the opening of the trans-Tasman travel bubble have been delayed as a result. ",
  "II. LUXEMBOURG ",
  "Luxembourg experienced a peak in cases towards the end of March, in May there were only a few cases per day. As a land-locked country in Europe, it provides important lessons in how travel restrictions combined with other measures can be effective in stopping an outbreak. Starting on March 18, 2020 a travel ban and entry restrictions were put in place. Third-country nationals were no longer permitted to enter the territory with the exception of Belgian, French and German cross-border workers. Frontier workers were issued a certificate that they were required to carry with them as proof of the need to cross the border. Additional exemptions included: ",
  "1) Citizens of the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, as well as their family members, in order to return to their place of residence ",
  "2) Third-country nationals who hold long-term resident status in accordance with European Directive 2003/109/EC on long-term residents, as well as any other person with a right of residence in accordance with European directives and national law in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or one of the neighboring countries; ",
  "3) Health professionals, health researchers and professionals involved in the care of the elderly; ",
  "4) Persons employed in the transport of goods and other persons employed in the goods and persons transportation sector, including airline personnel; ",
  "5) Members of the diplomatic corps, personnel of international organizations, military personnel, personnel in the field of development cooperation and humanitarian assistance, in the exercise of their respective functions; ",
  "6) Transit passengers; ",
  "7) Passengers travelling for urgent and duly justified family reasons; ",
  "8) Persons wishing to seek international protection or subsidiary protection in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or for other humanitarian reasons. ",
  "As of May 11, 2020 new measures for gradual exit from the state of confinement were rolled out aimed primarily at reopening of activities within the territory ",
  ". After drastically reducing daily new cases to only a few per day, cases have recently seen an uptick averaging 50 new cases per day. The Health ministry has linked the rise in cases to private parties. Travel restrictions for non-EU citizens were extended on June 30, 2020 and are expected to remain in place for at least two additional weeks.",
  "III. IRELAND ",
  "Ireland included travel restrictions as an integral part of the outbreak response effort. Restrictions remained in place even as other aspects of restrictions were relaxed. This includes both domestic and international travel. In particular, in phase 2 of opening up the economy the following restrictions and advisories were present: ",
  "1) All non-essential overseas travel to and from Ireland should be avoided. ",
  "2) Passengers arriving from outside the island of Ireland are expected to self-isolate for 14 days. ",
  "3) Stay Local: You may travel within your own county, or up to 20 kilometres from your home if crossing county boundaries. ",
  "Domestic travel restrictions were relaxed at phase 3 of the opening of the economy. More details are available at ",
  "and ",
  "IV. FRANCE ",
  "The French have adopted zoning, dividing into 101 \"départements\" and labelling them \"red\" or \"green\" according to the respective epidemiological situation, the hospital capacity, and the efficacy of testing and tracing. When starting to ease the lockdown on May 11, about half the départements where labeled red, the other half green. On June 2, all départements on the mainland became \"green\" and many restrictions were lifted. Nevertheless, stringent public health measures are still obligatory and several restrictions such as the size of public gatherings are still in place. ",
  "Two proposals that have informed these actions at the country level: ",
  ", and at the international level: ",
  "Travel into France became unrestricted for EU-Schengen citizens, though a 14-day quarantine is mandatory for travelers coming from the UK. Specific other countries that have few cases have been added to the travel list by shared policy across the EU, including at time of writing, Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, Uruguay, China, subject to confirmation of reciprocity ",
  ". Travel is restricted for foreigners from other countries with exemptions made for diplomats, residents, healthcare professionals working on COVID-19, and certain transporters of goods and passengers. ",
  "https: //reopen.europa.eu/en",
  "V. SPAIN ",
  "The Spanish economy depends heavily on tourism, being the world’s second most visited country, and has been under lockdown for several months. After a peak of new daily cases in April, Spain has since brought their new daily cases to the low hundreds. Spain has adopted a zoning strategy, dividing itself into its 59 provinces and islands (and in some cases even smaller divisions). Case distribution has been highly heterogeneous. Initially, travel between zones was restricted to only essential personal or professional reasons. ",
  "The European Commission and Spain have supported the creation of a European green zone network. ",
  "The Canaries, and Balearic Islands have announced they are opening travel restrictions to allow for tourists from other controlled regions in Europe. In Mallorca, travel restrictions were moved from July 1st to June 21 and an experiment is underway to allow for 5,000 German tourists to travel to the region. ",
  "We note that given that Germany during this period continues to have active community transmission this represents significant risk. As an example, travel would be better restricted to countries with fewer cases including Switzerland, Norway, Finland and Ireland, which are much closer to Green Zone status than Germany. Travel corridors should only be considered between regions that are Green Zones. Moreover, the arrangements for travel itself must be carefully considered to prevent infection in transit. The possibility of importing infected cases is real and can disrupt a region’s Green Zone status as manifest in recent cases imported to New Zealand.",

  "There have been many claims that opening or keeping open schools has little effect on the spread of the coronavirus SARSCoV-2, which causes COVID-19. However, empirical evidence shows that children can get severely sick with COVID-19 and that schools can have a large impact on its spread. While there is still much unknown about the exact transmission mechanism in children—further complicated by heterogeneity among children, as well as among societies and contexts—the question of how to act can often be answered without such detailed knowledge [1]. ",
  "There are many examples of schools and child-care facilities substantially contributing to the spread of the virus. To give a few: In Texas as of July 6, there were 894 confirmed cases among staff and 441 among children from 883 of the state’s child care facilities [2]. By contrast, Texas reported only 59 total cases in 53 childcare facilities on May 15. In Israel, which had reduced its total number of new cases nationwide to less than 20 per day in mid May, there were 130 cases from a single school by June 3, just two weeks after schools fully reopened [3]. In England, nearly 20% of outbreaks from June 15-21 were from schools [4]. ",
  "Some scientific analyses confirm the large role that schools play in spreading the virus, while there are others that do not find evidence of large effects from school closures [5]. Divergent results could be due to different modeling assumptions, as well as heterogeneity in the societies studied. For instance, if the virus is well-contained, schools are less likely to spread the virus, and if no other interventions besides school closures are enacted, such closures may not have as large an effect. There is also mixed evidence on the degree to which children spread the virus [6], which may arise in part because of substantial heterogeneity among children, with some infected children being far more contagious than others. ",
  "A common misconception is that children are rarely infected. CDC data indicates that as of April 2, 1.7% of confirmed cases are children (i.e. under 18 years of age) [7]. Given that people under 18 make up 22.3% of the 2019 U.S. population [8], this means that proportionally, children were 7.6% as likely to be infected as the general population. However, if infected children are less likely to be tested than infected adults (perhaps due to a greater percentage of children having milder or atypical symptoms), these numbers will be underestimates. A recent study analyzed contact-tracing data and found that children aged 0-14 were 34% as susceptible to the virus as adults aged 15-64 [9]. ",
  "Another misconception is that children rarely become severely ill. However, of the confirmed CDC cases, 5.7% of children vs. 10% of adults required hospitalization (20% of children vs. 33% of adults if only cases in which hospitalization data is available are counted) [7]. Thus, among these confirmed cases, hospitalization rates of adults and children differ by less than a factor of two. ",
  "While the exact degree of transmission among children and the precise impact of school openings/closures are still unknown, recent school openings have shown just how dangerous they can be. Schools and day-care centers have already caused many super-spreader events; as long as community transmission persists, schools and day-care centers that reopen or remain open will likely cause additional super-spreader events that will hinder containment efforts.",

  "The challenge of regulating travel during a pandemic is that the travel has both indirect economic benefits and indirect economic costs. The cost of a missed business trip or leisure travel is highly variable, as is the economic costs of induced outbreaks, as well as the disease, suffering and death that can arise. Unfortunately, wishful thinking based upon non-pandemic conditions may guide decision making so that clarity is needed both about what is known and not known for effective action.",
  " With cases reduced in some countries and the number of remaining cases being inherently heterogeneous due to localized outbreaks, one important question is how should travel be regulated. There are three categories of zones: Green zones without transmission risk because the number of community transmissions within the most recent 14 days is zero, Red zones where there is active transmission, and Yellow zones which neighbor Red zones and therefore require extra precautions. In recent times there is an effort to distinguish zones based upon statistical risk specified by the number of cases per capita. Here we discuss the considerations that make travel between zones risky for a zone that receives travelers from a non-green zone. ",
  "Who should be allowed to travel freely between zones?",
  " Travelers from confirmed green zone to green zone are ideal as candidates to travel freely. However travel itself carries risks of infection. For example, conventional travel with multiple hops through hub airports and potential layovers does not satisfy these conditions. ",
  "Green Zone to Green Zone:",
  "In order to ensure safe conditions the airplanes should fly direct from green zone to green zone. These planes would be restricted to green zone routes and the crew would live in the green zones. Trains, busses or cars can travel across intermediate zones but should not stop without special precautions in those areas. Departing from these strict conditions requires understanding the role of travel safety.",
  " The challenge of developing safe travel in a pandemic is made more difficult by the limited regulatory systems as well as financial interests of travel associated organizations. For example, it is apparent that airlines have been irresponsible actors in the outbreak and its response, with manifestly unsafe conditions, and resistance to implementing travel restrictions. Their financial vulnerability, that plays a strong role in their behavior, is not the starting point for effective travel safety. The cost of even one infected individual and resulting outbreak in a country where it occurs is very high. That these costs are not borne by the airlines results in economic motivations that are counter to the interests of both passengers and destination countries.",
  "Transit safety:",
  "In order to counter this adverse incentive structure, China has adopted a specific incentive mechanism: If no passenger arriving by flights on a route operated by an airline tests positive for three consecutive weeks, that airline is allowed to add one flight to the current weekly quota without exceeding the limit set in the route operating permit and with a cap of two flights a week. On the other hand, a penalty will be triggered when five passengers traveling by one route operated by an airline test positive. In this case, if less than ten passengers show positive results, the airline’s flights on this route shall be suspended for one week. If ten or more passengers test positive, the suspension will be extended to four weeks. Quotas reduced by penalty shall not be transferred to other routes. The airline can only resume its one-flight weekly schedule after the suspension ends.",
  "At this time there are insufficient baseline standards for safe in-flight conditions including airplanes and crew. There isn't an authority that is responsible for monitoring travel-induced transmission. National authorities are responsible only for their own country data. They do not have the necessary authority for collecting data and identifying risk and precautions. This means that we don't actually know what is the risk in travel. ",
  "For example, if someone shows up infected in one country, or locality within a country, we don't know if that infection arose during travel or prior to travel. Given the known high risk for indoor transmission and the limited understanding about the role of airplane ventilation, the challenge of passenger to passenger transmission as well as to and from the flight crew have not been adequately analyzed or addressed. ",
  "Technical note: In principle the effect of travel on infection transmission might be studied from the distribution of delay times of showing symptoms after arrival having a peak at the typical incubation period after travel. However, that study has not been made. Since analysis involves a deconvolution of the infection times with the incubation period, the statistical signal is reduced. Direct information about individuals prior to and after travel would be a more effective means for analysis. In the meantime, decisions must be made in absence of complete information. ",
  "Other forms of travel, by train, bus and car, require similar and additional conditions. Absent a concerted effort to develop clear guidelines this will continue to present an unreasonable risk with consequent outbreaks. ",
  " Travelers from red to green zones must undergo effective quarantine, monitoring and testing. One of the key questions is can travel be allowed between zones of similar disease incidence. There are multiple reasons that travel between zones introduces additional risks. In particular, people do not behave in a statistically average way. A randomly selected individual in one country, moved into another country, does not behave and does not have the same risk level as a randomly selected individual in the other country. Countries have to take strong actions to prevent outbreaks even if there is a single non-quarantined infected individual. Information is a key part of that process, and the transfer of individuals from one location to another means key information is not available. In particular:",
  "Travel Between Zones that are not Green:",
  "the travel itself creates a higher level of risk that has not been sufficiently evaluated (see above).",
  "the population in a particular area has an existing network structure, adding individuals that change that network structure changes the transmission dynamics.",
  "in particular, the geographic network of contacts of travelers that come in contact with an infected traveler is typically much larger than the one originating from a local individual, leading to more difficult contact tracing and potential for wide-spread outbreak.",
  "individuals who are typical travelers have a different network structure than local residents, with a tendency to engage in social behaviors and visit locations that are highly connected, including restaurants and bars for tourism and recreational travelers. Business travelers participate in meetings in addition to visiting restaurants and bars.",
  "there is information the traveler doesn't have about the local conditions (what are the existing restrictions on behaviors, where to go about testing, who to contact about symptoms, etc.)",
  "travelers have a different, and potentially reduced, incentive structure to protect others that are within the local population leading to behaviors with dramatically greater risk.  ",
  "traveler information and incentives lead to a reduced probability of self-reporting of symptoms due to incomplete information, language barriers, absence of local healthcare coverage, etc. This is exacerbated by the fact that a traveler usually has a clear goal---meetings, sightseeing, shopping, etc.---which makes days more purpose-driven. Any activity that deviates from this purpose (going for testing, going to see a doctor, looking for local information) has a higher opportunity cost both psychologically and financially. ",
  "there is missing information about the traveler and their contact network compared to local individuals that have regular and known behavior patterns. ",
  "the prior behavior patterns of local individuals are implicitly known because they are part of the history of the individual in the system, and their effects have already been incorporated in precautions that are being taken. This is not true about travelers.",
  "the prior behavior patterns are explicitly known in the social records of individuals, i.e. contact tracing information is available between individuals, including who was near whom. This information is more difficult to obtain for travelers with temporary and unusual encounters.",
  "Each of these adds risks that are much larger than those of the resident population.",
  "The implications of these additional risk factors is that ",
  "Equivalent levels of population incidence does not translate into equivalent risk for individuals who travel compared to those that are present in the population.",
  "In order to achieve effective risk control stronger measures must be taken for the travelers and also for the population given the risk of transmission.",
  "These stronger measures should lead to reduced transmission and thus an impetus to getting to zero. Importantly, this should motivate all countries to get to zero so that normal free travel can take place. ",

  "July 1, 2020",
  "There are challenges to getting to zero. What should be done to ensure extinction? Here we discuss: Risk psychology, and Counting cases. ",
  "I. RISK AND PSYCHOLOGY OF A FEW CASES IN A COUNTRY ",
  "Imagine a country that has reduced their number of cases dramatically to only a few, say 5 infectious individuals, in a population of 5 million. A person might say: “The likelihood of getting infected today is only about 1 in a million. That is so unlikely that I won’t take precautions.” And no precautions would be taken by that individual on that day. If everyone follows that rule, then someone will be infected. The number of infected individuals will go up. Each of the infectious people over a few days infects 3-5 others, they infect a few others, and we are off to the races with more and more cases. By the end of the first week there are about 50 cases, 500 after two weeks, 5,000 after three weeks. By then the odds have changed from 1 in 1 million, to 1 in 100,000, to 1 in 10,000, to 1 in 1,000. When do people decide to take precautions? At some point drastic action is necessary. Then the cases go down. At some point the country gets to the situation where people say, \"OK now there is only one in a million chance of being infected.\" Again the infections will grow. How do we stop this cyclic process? There is a need for three actions: ",
  "• ",
  "—People in general have to recognize that the only way to stop is to get to zero so that everyone takes some precautions until there are zero cases. Getting to zero takes another week or two, depending on the strength of actions taken. ",
  "—Everyone has to participate by quickly identifying early symptoms. Contact tracing teams identify likely contacts, they quarantine and test both symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts (of order 100 of them). ",
  "—precautions are taken where cases are, and not in areas where they aren’t. The relaxation of restrictions goes by geographical region, not by business type or profession. This requires restrictions on nonessential travel between zones, so that individuals don’t transfer infections from one zone to another. Areas where the disease is found have a higher chance of infection so people naturally take strong action, while in areas without cases people don’t need to follow restrictions. Because of zoning, the number of cases is taken relative to the local population instead of the national population. Take, for example, 5 cases in a county of 50,000 in a nation of 5M population. Instead of 5M people being concerned only a little (5/5M), we have 50K alert people with (5/50K = 1 in 10,000) and 4.950M people living an almost ordinary life (including normal economic activity), but following zone travel restrictions until the last zone is cleared.

  "Green Zone strategy",
  "II. COUNTING CASES ",
  "For countries where the number of cases is low, counting the cases is very important. Since the difference between zero cases and 1 or 2 cases matters, we need to focus our attention on counting them correctly. The risk that the country faces depends on the cases for which transmission can occur. Some cases have a low risk of transmission. There are three important categories for which transmission is under control that we shouldn’t count. ",
  "If there are travelers that come to the country and on arrival are quarantined for 14 days in an effective way, they are not contagious during that time and if they become sick, they can be cared for in isolation without leading to new cases. There are several key statements that are essential and should be noted: ",
  "Travelers: ",
  "1) arrival takes place without opportunity to infect anyone ",
  "2) quarantine is carefully done by authorities, if they are responsible ",
  "3) quarantine is carefully adhered to by the individual, if the individual is self-isolating ",
  "4) reporting of symptoms is carefully made ",
  "This is sufficient if there are a few cases that arrive. This is not enough if many individuals are arriving because of lower probability events: Cases where symptoms arise in more than 14 days, and cases that are asymptomatic. These two types of cases are, in effect, similar. A truly asymptomatic carrier is not manifestly different from someone who becomes symptomatic after an extended period of time. A discussion of additional precautions is given in the Appendix. ",
  "When an individual is diagnosed and their contacts are quarantined, the purpose of that quarantine is to prevent further infections and to minimize undesirable consequences of uncertainty. Some of those individuals then may become sick but if the quarantine is properly done those cases are not able to infect others. We term them pre-quarantined due to contact tracing. The conditions for this are: ",
  "Individuals quarantined due to contact tracing: ",
  "1) they have to be a long enough time in quarantine before showing symptoms (several days) ",
  "2) they have to strictly follow the quarantine whether by authorities or in self-quarantine ",
  "3) if the conditions of the quarantine are insufficient, other individuals may have to be quarantined that were exposed to them. ",
  "If so they are not counted as transmission risks. ",
  " The central objective of contact tracing is to prevent further infections from those infected by a known case. If completely successful, then the known case can be removed from the set of cases that transmit the disease. ",
  "Mitigation of risk by contact tracing:",
  "More generally, contact tracing helps to identify the sequence of disease transmission, both precursor and successor cases of an identified case. This may include individuals who live together, work together, or more generally are part of the same immediate geographic area or social network. Since there are mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals that may be part of the transmission chain, contacts of contacts should be included as high-risk individuals. A target number of individuals to be considered is 10-100. In some circumstances there is clear distinction between high-risk and low-risk individuals due to behavioral clarity of the individual or stay-at-home conditions. ",
  "Individuals identified as contacts have to be tested and/or quarantined. Often both. It is important to test all individuals who might be the source of the infection to narrow the search across potential other transmission routes. Testing all possible contacts, symptomatic or non-symptomatic, increases the likelihood of identifying the transmission channel and tracking it through the population. Since an individual who was the source of transmission may no longer be a carrier, serological tests should be used (in addition to RT-PCR tests) as they determine with some degree of accuracy whether a person has been sick in the past. If all individuals that are transmission risks are identified and quarantined, then there are no uncontrolled transmission risks. Even if they become sick, their quarantine guarantees that the chain of transmission will be stopped. ",
  "Omitting the travelers, prequarantined, and fully contact-traced individuals, the remainder of the cases are known as “community transmission.” For these individuals we don’t have clear identification of the limits of transmission. We know that there are prior individuals in the chain of transmission, perhaps unknown, and individuals that may have been infected subsequently. ",
  "Community transmission: ",
  " We need to count the number of cases in the past 14 days that may lead to further infections. This is the number of community transmissions, which is given by",
  "Summary for counting cases:",
  "Nx = Nc − Nt − Nq − Np        (1) ",
  "where Nc is the number of new cases in 14 days, Nt is the number of quarantined arriving travelers that are new cases, Nq the number of contact tracing based quarantined new cases, Np is the number of new cases that through complete contact tracing cannot infect any non-quarantined individuals. Any of the cases for which certainty of prevention of transmission is not complete should not be subtracted. To the extent it is possible to quantify risk reduction fractional counts may be considered. For example, if someone is quarantined and they subsequently become symptomatic or test positive, there is a risk factor associated with the timing of their quarantine. If the timing is not sufficiently early, a fractional multiplier for risk may be considered. Risks should be conservatively evaluated. Finally, some care can also be used in distinguishing the timing of reporting of cases from the timing of their infectious periods. The key is to ensure that individuals are counted if the period of infectiousness overlaps the most recent 14 day period. ",
  " Zones with no community transmissions, Nx = 0 even with Nc > 0, can be regarded as green zones. Governments and individuals living in green zones can relax restrictions given that contact tracing and quarantine measures are expected to be sufficient to prevent transmission. Still, everyone should be be ready to roll back quickly into restrictions if new community transmissions emerge. In this circumstance, it is important to actively trace cases to determine which part was not done sufficiently identifying which of the Nt, Nq, Np was not properly accounted for so this can be avoided in the future. ",
  "Green zones:",
  "APPENDIX: ADDITIONAL STEPS WHEN MANY TRAVELERS ARE ARRIVING ",
  "When there are many travelers and the probability of infection is not very low the likelihood that some are asymptomatic carriers must be addressed by additional precautions that impose significantly larger burden: ",
  "1) It is known that in a few cases the incubation period is longer than 14 days. This is the tail of the incubation period distribution and happens in a small proportion of cases. If the number of travelers is large, this will happen sufficiently many times that additional precautions are needed. This includes a longer quarantine period of perhaps 18 or 20 days. The larger number of travelers, the higher the chance that the travelers are infected, the longer the quarantine period should be. The precise number of days has to be calibrated to have a low probability of a new outbreak. ",
  "2) Instead of a full quarantine extension, a longer period of partial quarantine might be used. Taking this period to be an additional week, this might include one or more of the following during an additional third week: Only participating in a specific social event, engaging in social distancing at any event, only seeing a few designated individuals, not going to events with more than a few individuals, not going to high density or large number of people events. It should be noted that these restrictions don’t prevent all transmission, only the risk of a large outbreak. Moreover, if one other person is infected, and that person participates in large events, even superspreader events are not fully prevented by this approach. Early detection is essential. ",
  "3) In order to prevent transmission by asymptomatic individuals testing that detects infected asymptomatic individuals with some probability may be used. This includes nasal swab tests, anal swab tests, and CT scans. Due to false negatives, multiple tests may be needed to rule out infection.",

Our calculation shows that for 10,000 CT-scans 124 lives are saved this year (within months), 2,074 diagnosed cases are prevented, 415 hospitalizations are prevented along with subsequent short and long term disability. Well established estimates imply 1 future cancer may result.",
  "The use of CT scans in conjunction with RT-PCR for diagnosis of COVID-19 in symptomatic individuals can address the problems caused by 30% false negative rate RT-PCR, time delays in obtaining results, and limited availability [1]. The high false negative rate means almost 1 in 3 infected individuals with mild symptoms are informed they are not infected and will not isolate and thus infect others. Moreover, since effective isolation is difficult, symptomatic individuals do not completely isolate after testing while pending results. Given the extended turnaround time for diagnostic PCR results, individuals with COVID-19 continue to expose others to the virus. Using CT scans with immediate interpretation by radiologists (or in the future AI algorithms) reduces the time an infected individual can infect others, low false negative rates further contribute to the reduction in transmission. ",
  "Here we analyze the benefits obtained in an outbreak context for CT screening of symptomatic individuals. Our results show that for 10,000 CT-scans 124 lives are saved this year (within months), 2,074 diagnosed cases are prevented (out of a total of 3,039 cases), 415 hospitalizations are prevented, along with all of the subsequent short and long term disability that will impact health, healthcare costs and society as a whole in the upcoming years. The outbreak duration will be shortened enabling economic activity to be restored. An often expressed concern is the potential for CT-scans to cause cancers. We calculated the expected cancers resulting from the CT-scans. Screening of symptomatic individuals can be performed with low dose non-contrast CT-scans (LDCT are currently reimbursed by governmental payers in the US at roughly $70-130 by Medicaid and Medicare respectively). The low level of radiation exposure from LDCT has not been shown to cause cancer. However, the currently accepted model of predicting lifetime risk of fatal cancer is 5% per sV given to a population [6]. This estimate implies 1 fatal cancer per 10,000 patients scanned using a 2 mSv LDCT [2]. \t \t \t\t",

  "We know what can happen when COVID-19 catches a city off guard. Wuhan, central China, the unsuspecting ground zero of the COVID-19 outbreak, saw a tsunami of tens of thousands of COVID-19 cases quickly overwhelm their health care system within a matter of weeks. After some initial delays - now typical for many other countries - China reacted swiftly and relentlessly. China escalated a response unlike any the world has seen before and which many have still not fully appreciated. Extraordinary public health measures, pulling from the full armamentarium of non-pharmaceutical interventions [1], were implemented. These included early identification of cases by prompt laboratory testing, hospital or facility-based isolation of all cases [2], rigorous contact tracing and meticulous follow-up of quarantined contacts, enhanced by artificial intelligence [3]. In the community, mobility was restricted and social contact minimised. ",
  "A lockdown of the entire city was instituted to protect the rest of the country and the rest of the world. The lockdown started on 23 January, 2020, at a time of 495 laboratory confirmed cases. New cases continued to increase exponentially before peaking on 12 February 2020, with 15,152 new cases on that day. Thereafter cases declined almost daily. By 18 March 2020, no new cases were occurring. By that date Wuhan had recorded 50,005 cases, or just over 60% of the total 81,092 cases reported in China. With ‘only’ 81,092 cases in a population of more than 1,4 billion people in China, there would be basically no population-level herd immunity, even if we assume an additional 50% asymptomatic rate. China showed that containment of COVID-19 is possible. Only when the outbreak was contained with cases down to zero for more than 4 weeks (corresponding to twice the duration of the maximum incubation time), China incrementally eased the restrictions. At the same time, China put preparedness plans into action including upscaling of testing capabilities and building of new capacities, to detect and quickly contain the next wave due to increasing importations from the new epicentres that are springing up elsewhere in the world. ",
  "Despite early warnings in January 2020, the international community was slow to respond in building testing capabilities, contact tracing and isolation and quarantine measures [4]. While Asian countries, traumatized and experienced by the relative recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, swiftly put action plans in place to identify importations and new clusters—essentially without lockdowns--the rest of the world saw a series of Tsunami-like waves of outbreaks with rapidly moving epicentres: first Northern Italy, then Spain, New York, United Kingdom, and then by May, Brazil and Russia became the new epicentres. By 28 May 2020, the tragic toll of COVID-19 entailed more than 5.5 million infections and more than 350,000 deaths globally. The exponential rise in cases and deaths forced much of Europe and then many other countries around the world including the United States to implement lockdowns, either at national or sub-national level. Natural herd immunity would be expected to require at least 60% of the population to have been infected [5]. Clearly, with COVID-19 achieving “natural herd immunity” as the end game would be associated with an enormous death toll and a prolonged and crushing pressure on health care systems, and collateral damage on all other sectors [5]. ",
  "Policy-makers are debating two strategies to reduce deaths and the demand on health care utilization6 , in addition to considering major collateral damage to economic, society, mental health and other outcomes: (a) containment or suppression of COVID-19, which aims to reverse the rate of epidemic growth, thereby reducing new case numbers to low levels, and (b) mitigation, which focuses on slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread – to reduce peak healthcare demand while protecting those most at risk of severe disease from infection. Containment requires all out action to reduce the reproductive number, R, to below 1, thus causing case numbers to decline. Mitigation aims to merely slow spread by reducing R, but not to below 1, and new cases continue to rise. ",
  "There are three reasons why containment is the much-preferred option. First, the rapid reduction in the number of cases that can be achieved is almost the mirror of the rapid increase, occurring over a very short period of time-potentially as short as a few weeks. Second, the period of large-scale impacts including suffering, death and economic impacts is limited to these weeks. Third, an all-out short-term approach to containment will most likely have a lower socio-economic impact than longer-term mitigation efforts. ",
  "A wide range of specific control measures are considered in policy discussions. But the prescription for ‘all-out containment’ should essentially include three key aspects that together achieve what any one cannot by itself: ",
  "First, movement restrictions: It is well understood that by themselves movement and travel restrictions do nothing but delay an outbreak [7]. However, combined with reductions in the local transmission rate, such restrictions can be a critical component of a complete strategy. International travel restrictions and national or sub-national movement restrictions, restrict the outbreak to more limited areas reducing the human and economic costs, and allowing available resources to be focused on priority regions. For example, China sent 42,000 health workers from other parts of China to Hubei province to help in the response effort, allowing areas that were less affected to have more lenient restrictions. Even now, when Europe and the US are implementing almost complete lockdowns, later, during the recovery phase when restrictions are being relaxed, areas that are less impacted will recover first with earlier lifting of lockdown measures. ",
  "Second, active case finding and reporting: The benefit of rapid laboratory testing of even mildly symptomatic cases with prompt isolation, and contact tracing with enforced quarantine of contacts should be clear [8].  The delay between symptom onset and isolation has the largest role in determining whether an outbreak would be controllable, therefore prompt isolation of all cases should be the primary goal [9]. Cases that are not isolated result in a high secondary attack rate. Institution-based isolation, even of mild cases, was modelled to reduce the outbreak size by more than 50% [10]. 14 temporary facilities were built in China for different levels of severity including sports arenas that had makeshift hospitals to look after the mild cases. In Wuhan such accommodation amounted to 50,000 beds. Likewise, in Korea 4,000 beds were created over 20 dormitories. The determination to isolate positive cases was maintained even when huge transmission was underway, thus reducing the subsequent transmission. In contrast, most of Europe and the United States continue to rely on people`s compliance on self-isolation at home. ",
  "Third, lockdown: The anchor for the containment effort is the lockdown of active outbreak areas, which ensures transmission is dramatically curtailed to manageable numbers, thus enabling the re-establishment of contact tracing to be effective. It also ensures that no further importations occur via incoming travelers. An effective lockdown requires government to engage directly in supporting economic activity, including the provision of necessities by safe measures. Economic support for placing much of the economy on `pause” must be implemented. Given a limited period of weeks for such a pause -if done correctly [11] - the disruption need not be the devastation that would occur for longer periods. This is another reason that all-out efforts are essential. Without all-out lockdowns, testing, and travel restrictions, the duration of effective interventions dramatically increases. ",
  "The combination of three interventions in an all-out assault on COVID-19 can not only contain the outbreak but do so within 5-7 weeks almost independently of the level the outbreak has reached; a logarithmic correction in time is almost unnoticeable given the exponential decline in number of cases. Travel restrictions limit the area of outbreak and provide a means of progressively relaxing local control efforts geographically; testing and contact tracing reduce R0 locally and limit the number of isolations that are required; and the lockdown acts to limit transmission to cohabitants, dramatically reducing R0, and limiting the number of individuals that need to be traced. Finally, effective contact tracing for a disease that is dominated by close contacts can control new outbreaks. Overall the current outbreak can be resolved within 1-3 months as suggested by modelling [9] and the China experience. The recovery process can be shortened as well by government policies that protect individuals and corporations through the pause in most economic activity. The fear of an extended recurring outbreak scenario should not impede actions that are effective and will reduce both the human and economic costs. ",
  "But, the argument goes, a new outbreak may occur afterwards when lock-down measures relax resulting in the re-emergence of indigeneous chains of transmission or new importations. However, the success in China and South Korea to date, and Hong Kong and Taiwan`s containment achievements, suggests that new importations need not lead to new outbreaks. Modelling has shown that not all contacts need to be identified to ensure a suppression of the epidemic curve. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with less than 50% of contacts successfully traced, and to control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2.5 more than 70% of contacts have to be traced [9].",
  "The lockdown is a window of opportunity to bolster basic public health systems. If basic public health systems had been in place earlier on, lockdowns would not have been necessary. Lockdowns provide some additional time to build up basic public health interventions needed to suppress new outbreaks without having to necessarily reinstate the economically damaging lockdown measures. The lockdown period should be used to prepare and implement best practices for the next wave. This includes upscaling testing capabilities and increasing the capacity and work force for contact tracing. To this end, we commend the United Kingdom`s efforts to build up a work force of more than 17,000 contact tracing staff. While traditional shoe-leather contact tracing should remain a core function in the “test, trace, treat” strategy, in our highly mobile populations, digital technologies can enhance contact tracing and retain privacy. In Taiwan and South Korea, the legal basis and data governance structure for responsible accessing and managing personal information during a health crisis was prepared after the 2003 SARS and 2015 MERS outbreaks. Mobile phone use for epidemiological purposes is not new [12]. The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule may serve as a foundation for COVID-19 contact tracing [3]. Europe’s new privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), which ensures data protection and social media privacy for all individual citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Union (EU) might be further expanded to address the need of digital disease surveillance during COVID19 [3]. Researchers, IT programmers, Google and Apple have developed ways to enable contact-tracing without mass surveillance to achieve the benefits of location-tracking while protecting individual privacy. ",
  "The World Health Organization set out 6 criteria countries need to meet before lifting lockdown restrictions (",
  "). These criteria include that health system capacities are in place to test, isolate, and treat every case and trace every contact; minimize risks in special settings like health facilities and nursing homes; social distancing principles at workplaces, schools and other essential places; minimizing importation of new cases from countries or areas that have not yet contained the outbreak; community willingness to continue social distancing wherever possible and community engagement in all measures. ",
  "Lockdowns are being eased incrementally in many locations. Unfortunately, many countries are relaxing restrictions without having achieved zero community transmission, without which a resurgence is likely both increasing incidence of disease and prolonging the time until full reopening is possible. All countries are naturally keen to restart their economies but priorities also factor in social and cultural activities of importance. Arrangements for air travel between specific countries are underway and risks are high unless both countries are near or at zero transmission. ",
  "While testing and contact tracing capacity have been ramped up, these are only effective when the number of cases is small enough. While some individuals, communities and countries are continuing to take social distancing seriously, the enthusiasm about returning to normalcy has the potential to undermine the lessons learnt. It seems many have forgotten how aggressive this virus is in death, in severity of disease, and in crippling a health system, overwhelming it and allowing amplification of fatalities. More cases and more clusters will appear and different countries will manage these differently. Indeed, it is likely that as countries come out of lockdown most will need to revisit lockdowns in some form or another as community transmission grows. How this is managed will be a major test of leadership and community engagement in every country. The opportunity remains to use widespread testing to selectively identify regions of a country and reopen economic activity and travel as those regions become transmission free, accelerating the process of economic recovery.

  "We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as 50×, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate R(t) is 0.20. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing.",

  "Travel restrictions (Cordon Sanitaire) are a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19 to reduce transmission to zero (#CrushTheCurve) and restore normal activity. By limiting travel, gains from local efforts to stop the disease can be preserved because new outbreaks arising from travelers can be prevented. Without such restrictions any effort to stop the outbreak in one place will be undermined by imported cases. Waiting for all areas to achieve low enough case counts would substantially delay restoring economic activity. Travel restrictions should apply to travelers from a high risk area to any other area, including other high risk areas.",
  " The status of a designated area (zone) should be identified as being in one of three colors: Green, Yellow and Red. ",
  "• Green zone—no new local (within community) transmission for 14 consecutive days. All new cases, if any, occur in individuals who were effectively isolated from the moment they entered the zone (imported travelers); ",
  "• Yellow zone—no new local transmission for 14 consecutive days, but there are new cases identified using contact tracing, or the zone is adjacent to red zones; ",
  "• Red zone—community transmission identified within the last 14 days. ",
  "A zone should be a district that is naturally or artificially separated from its neighboring districts. A zone should only have controllable traffic transitions with neighboring zones. If two geographical regions have a shared border that cannot be effectively controlled, they should be considered as one zone. Zones can have a nested structure where the largest unit is a country or state. Zones should reduce the number of border crossings as necessary to ensure proper transport guidelines and quarantine are followed. ",
  "The most basic zone border protocol includes: ",
  "• No unnecessary travel into any zone from a yellow or red zone. ",
  "• 14 day quarantine for any individual arriving with permission into any zone from a yellow or red zone. ",
  "• Provision for transit travel if complete isolation protocols (air port transit isolation, not leaving a land vehicle, not leaving a designated road area) during transit across a zone. Where feasible, services should be provided for transit travel with extreme precautions. ",
  "• Import of goods by delivery to a designated cargo border location and transfer of the goods to internal control. ",
  "A more complete zone land border control infrastructure enables a wider range of travel options, with appropriate control to prevent transmission. ",
  "Temporary border control locations are necessary right before entering and exiting zones. These may be newly formed or converted service areas or weigh stations. To these areas add hygienic and clean air self-service facilities that protect both the traveler and the community. For freight/cargo drivers, they should be required to perform essential activities (like dining) in these service areas to minimize exposure in the zone. Such self-service facilities will also help travelers from one green zone to another green zone if their route has to cut through yellow/red zones. Negative pressure ambulances should also be deployed at such service areas for medical emergencies, and for out-of-zone individuals seeking medical care in inzone hospitals. ",
  "Zones must set up a system for travelers from yellow/red zones to notify zone local authorities in advance about their arrival, indicated by signs along the transit road and online, including registering their name, license plate number, and ETA. Upon arrival at the entry service area, travelers are redirected directly to isolation facilities. Ideally, the isolation facility should be close to the border control service area, and they can also serve as the temporary lodging space for officials working at the service area, to minimize their contact with the community. Symptomatic testing (fever and questionnaire) should be standard at all crossing points. Where available, RTPCR rapid nasal swab tests should be performed. Test results should be added to official travel documents when available. Arrivals without registration are denied entry. ",
  "Travel restrictions should be based on local needs. There are four aspects of travel: (1) Arrivals into a zone, (2) essential worker travel, (3) transit across one zone to get to another, (4) delivery of goods. ",
  "I. ARRIVALS INTO A ZONE ",
  "In general, travelers arriving from yellow or red zones to any other zone (green, yellow or red) should be quarantined or self-isolate with supervision for 14 days. Travelers originating in green zones may not need to be quarantined if they are coming from another low risk area. In order to avoid the need for more stringent restrictions, travelers should have official or otherwise reliable itinerary records (origin, intended destination, zones they have traveled through) and tests with results (if possible) from zones they have passed through on their journey. A system for official travel documents should be developed. ",
  "Patients from a yellow or red zone seeking medical services should be encouraged to find treatment in their home zone. If they are unable to obtain services in their home zone they may seek treatment in specifically designated clinics or hospitals that have the proper protocols in place to receive inbound patients who may be infected. Travel from the zone boundary to the service center should be supervised and documented for tracing purposes. ",
  "II. ESSENTIAL WORKER TRAVEL ",
  "In order to separate transmission in different zones, individuals who regularly travel between two zones for work and living quarters must do one of the following: ",
  "1) Temporarily change work or living quarters so that they are within the same zone; ",
  "2) Follow strict guidelines for isolation from local population in one of the two zones. This may include living alone or working without contact with other employees; ",
  "3) Change roles so that remote work is possible; ",
  "4) Take a temporary leave of absence with pay. ",
  "Where this is not possible, frequent screening tests are necessary. In a case where individuals who live or work in boundary regions between two zones that are both of reduced risk, exceptions may be made for essential workers. Essential workers who are COVID-19 positive should quarantine in their home zone. ",
  "Under exceptional circumstances essential workers may arrive or be imported into a zone with zone authority approved quarantine and work plans that ensure extremely low risk for transmission employment conditions. ",
  "III. TRANSIT OR THRU TRAFFIC ",
  "Transit airport, highway and major road traffic should not be blocked. However, precautions must be taken at entrance into a zone and pit stop locations. If a zone decides to allow an individual from a higher risk zone to travel across to get to another zone it would be prudent to track the vehicle for enforcement of regulations and tracing purposes. Designate controlled routes and pit stops to ensure through-zone transit is safe for residents. ",
  "Through-zone travelers should avoid pit stops if possible. When necessary, wear a mask, practice distancing and thoroughly wash hands. Add pit stop to travel itinerary for tracing purposes. ",
  "IV. DELIVERY OF GOODS ",
  "Freight should have clear destinations and itinerary. Set up quarantine areas for freight drivers to go once they have delivered their goods. They either return to their origin the same day or wait in a quarantine area until their next job. Packages should undergo sanitation or quarantine for a period of time to deactivate any virus on fomites and prevent transmission. ",
  "In general, for transport into a yellow or red zone, freight drivers must quarantine upon return to their home zone. Freight and cargo transport without quarantine upon return is possible, provided the following conditions are met: ",
  "1) There are no symptoms of illnesses; ",
  "2) Vehicle operators do not leave the vehicle, with exceptions for designated and reliably managed pit stop locations; ",
  "3) Loading and unloading is carried out by the customer; ",
  "4) The vehicle operators leave the zone again within 24 hours. ",
  "For trips that last longer than 24 hours, upon return they should quarantine while they wait for the next transport job. If they want to reenter their zone without restrictions they must quarantine or self-isolate for 14 days. ",

  "Before you begin to restart the economy make sure you are not starting another economic collapse. Premature relaxation of restrictions will guarantee loss of all that was gained. A premature relaxation, even briefly, would seed new transmissions that cannot be undone within weeks. ",
  "Conditions and process to follow: ",
  "1) Relax restrictions locally by geographically isolated regions (not by industry group, trade or occupation). ",
  "2) Assure that travel restrictions prevent new cases from entering. Fines or repatriation may help reduce the motivation to sneak in. ",
  "3) Stop community transmission (travelers or prior case contacts that are in quarantine when they become ill do not prevent opening up) ",
  "4) Make sure sufficient testing gives ability to identify regions free of the virus. Even after cases drop sharply, widespread testing should be continued for at least another 2 weeks to prevent clustered transmission caused by individuals with a long incubation period or false negative tests. ",
  "5) There should be no new locally transmitted cases within last incubation period of 14 days. ",
  "6) Assure facilities for isolation and medical care of positively identified cases. ",
  "7) Set up contact tracing. ",
  "8) Multiple steps should be taken to stage the relaxation of restrictions and monitor for new cases. ",
  "9) Ensure masks are worn for several weeks after opening up. ",
  "10) The last steps to take in opening up are to allow public transportation and large meetings to avoid superspreader events, and to relax restrictions on high risk institutions and vulnerable populations. ",
  "Still, while restrictions are present, some things are still possible: ",
  "1) Going outdoors in an area where other people are very rare. ",
  "2) Meeting one or two people outdoors but staying 18-27 ft (6-9 m) apart (6 ft is not enough). Closer distances are possible when wind is blowing. ",
  "3) Driving and staying in your car in low density areas. ",
  "Opening schools ",
  "1) Start with meetings outdoors with no contact between teacher and student one on one. ",
  "2) Arrange small group meetings outdoors with no contact in areas with excellent ventilation. ",
  "3) Arrange play dates with two students, preferably outdoors. If indoors, then restrict only to connection between two families that have been safely isolating for 14 days.",

  "What can an individual do to reduce their risk of a severe case of COVID-19? In the absence of a cure, improving the health of an individual, especially pulmonary health, is important. Hydration, balanced nutrition, appropriate exercise and regular sleep may help. Once an individual is infected, fresh air and cleaning the environment are recommended. This helps protect those who interact with a patient in home or healthcare settings. It also reduces re-exposure to viral particles that the individual may cough, sneeze or breathe out. Rebreathing viral particles may lead to infection of other parts of the lung and increase viral load. ",
  "Attention to wellness during the mild period of COVID-19 may impact whether it becomes severe. Among the well established means of strengthening the immune response to many viruses are elevated hydration, balanced nutrition (chicken or egg drop soup!), good sleep habits, and not interfering with elevated temperature unless it exceeds safe limits (103◦F, 39.5 ◦C) [1]. Improving respiratory health before becoming infected, should also improve outcomes. ",
  "Good ventilation and frequent cleaning of the environment of individuals that are ill with COVID-19 is widely recommended by health authorities [2–5]. This is critical for anyone who must interact with a patient, whether family members in the home, or healthcare providers in medical settings. It may also provide benefits through reducing re-exposure of the individual to viral particles, which may affect pulmonary tissue that is not yet infected, or has been recently cleared by the immune system. ",
  "Deep breathing has been shown to improve respiratory health and patient outcomes across a number of conditions [6–8]. While more intensive chest physiotherapy has not been found effective in treating hospitalized pneumonia patients [9], for mild symptoms standard breathing exercises may be beneficial. ",
  "In about 80% of cases, COVID-19 has only mild symptoms and individuals recover without requiring significant medical intervention. In 20% of cases the disease becomes severe, 10% require Intensive Care to survive, including ventilators. and 2- 4% of cases result in death. The outcome is also sensitive to underlying cardiovascular health and risk increases dramatically with age. In a typical case the disease begins mild, and after several weeks suddenly progresses to become severe. A competition between viral replication and elimination by the immune system underlies disease progression. A sudden onset of severity indicates that the battle reaches a transition (tipping point) to a lethal phase. This may be due to the extent of damage to lung tissue, overload of some capacity of the immune system, auto-immune impacts such as a Cytokine storm, or other mechanisms. The sensitivity of the transition to multiple factors suggests that even a small change in individual conditions may shift the balance. Strengthening the immune system or reducing the ability of the virus to spread across the pulmonary tissue may be helpful. ",
  "The coronavirus spreads via droplets from coughs, sneezes and exhaled air of individuals who carry the virus (regardless of whether they show symptoms). The following recommendations to improve pulmonary health and reduce exposure / reexposure to viral particles are safe for individuals in reasonable all-around health. Anyone with specific health concerns or respiratory issues may wish to consult their physician before adopting them. Please note that these recommendations will not substitute for prevention, we only hope that they may reduce the severity in some cases. ",
  "RECOMMENDATIONS ",
  "Before infection aerobic exercise strengthens cardiovascular health. Once infected, during the period of mild symptoms, moderate daily aerobic exercise can improve lung ventilation. Such exercise may benefit immune function as well [10]. Ideally, do this exercise outdoors or with open windows or otherwise well ventilated areas. In sufficiently warm climates, longer walks or even running may improve lung capacity. Jumping jacks, jogging in place, or dancing can be done even in small spaces. ",
  "Aerobic exercise. ",
  ". It is best for airflows to be outward, and surely not to allow airflow from an infected individual toward spaces where uninfected individuals are present [5]. This has two benefits: (1) allowing any viral particles present in the air to exit the room, rather than you (or someone else) breathing them back in; (2) bringing more oxygen into the room—helpful for the lungs and all-around health. If the weather in your region is cold, consider opening the window at least a small amount while also running a heater. Air purifiers may also be helpful. ",
  "Keep windows open where temperatures allow",
  "(without approaching others within 6 ft. [11]). Balconies, back yards or patios, are good locations to be, as well as walks while avoiding proximity to others. This has the same benefits as keeping windows open—ensuring exhaled viral particles don’t get re-inhaled. ",
  "Spend time outdoors ",
  ". Breathing through the nose helps clean incoming air, via cilia (small hairs) and mucous membranes, thus creating a shield against disease. Nasal breathing also warms and moistens incoming air. ",
  "Breathe in through the nose",
  ". Deep breathing and exhalation bring fresh air in and can improve lung capacity. We typically breathe in and out only a fraction of our lung’s capacity. Expelling viral particles from the more stagnant areas of the lung may further decrease self-exposure to viral particles. Deep breathing is often recommended for health and well being and can be done multiple times a day on a regular schedule. ",
  "Deep breathing",
  ". Outdoors or with open window: Breathe out, turn to breath in clean air. Repeat multiple times, and periodically. Where fresh air is not available, use HEPA air purifier day and night. ",
  "Avoid viral rebreathing",
  " Many additional exercises can be found for enhancing respiratory health. See Rush University Medical Center recommendations [12] for more nuanced exercises. Clean surfaces and wash clothing and bedding. Frequent washing removes viral particles that are deposited on surfaces and clothing and prevents exposure or reexposure. ",

  "April 17, 2020",
  "How can we identify effective treatments for COVID-19 fast? The standard for proving treatments is double blind statistical studies. But statistical studies are a way of looking for small effects that require large populations to see. This is a good idea for diseases where all the obvious things to do have been tried. But for a new disease, we need the most basic approach to be set free: Doctors should determine what works based upon manifest effects. ",
  "If an intervention is a good one, the results become clear within a short period of time and for an individual patient. Physicians are not waiting for approval for developing postural actions, like placing a patient in a prone position instead of on a ventilator because they can see the effect. The formal way to talk about this is that there are markers of the disease condition. Sophisticated approaches are possible, but for a disease we have just begun to treat, looking for obvious big wins should be the first option. ",
  "What we can do immediately is to help improve physicians ability to see what is happening. One of the best tools for this is CT-scans. They provide a 3-D view of what is going on in the lungs, including both the number of sites of damage and their extent. They can show the infection even before the patient reports symptoms (presymptomatic) and or when they are mild. This gives a snapshot of the condition of the lung early in the disease, or as it progresses. ",
  "The main question then is can we do multiple scans on an individual to see what is happening over time? The answer is yes. A single low dose CT lung screen is well below 1mSievert, perhaps 0.5, about the same as 3 round trip international flights [1]. The background annual radiation in the US is 2-3 mSievert [2]. Surely 2 CT-scans is reasonable, perhaps more. Protocols for low dose CT cancer screening exist [3]. A few CT-scans would enable looking directly at the dynamics of the disease, revealing what controls progression in interventions and treatment. ",
  "An often expressed concern is contamination of the CT equipment. This can be mitigated in a variety of ways, including the use of a transparent head-and-torso-encompassing plastic bag cinched at the waist to complete isolation of the patient, with a helmet, one tube for intake and another for exhaust connected to a suction pump and an ULPA filter that entraps particles down to the size of individual viral particles. Patient isolation can happen prior to their entry into the CT examination room. ",
  "Instead of looking for a small effect, let’s look for a large effect. Then we can know how to treat. ",
  "We should separate two different periods: The early period to prevent progression, the later period to increase chance of improvement. A potential challenge is that when a person is severely infected improvement may not be as visible because of the persistence of fluid in the lung that makes it harder to see healing. So perhaps the focus should be on the early period, which also dovetails with using CT-scans for case identification to overcome the testing logjam [4, 5]. ",
  "Interventions that can be considered include medications like the much discussed chloroquine, but there are many possible medications as well as physical manipulations like prone positions, and ideas like reducing self-exposure to viral particles using fresh air and HEPA or ULPA filters. Having different medical teams look at different options to explore in parallel what might work and advancing our understanding rapidly is the way to go. Once there is visibility we can see what happens. Statistics can wait. ",
  "Visibility should be the first priority. ",

  "Click here to download the PDF",
  "COVID-19 is mainly transmitted via aerosols and droplets and can exist on fomites—surfaces, equipment, utensils, fabric, hair, dust and other particles—for days. The disease may be spread when people touch contaminated surfaces and then touch their face. Regular cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces that are frequent touch-points helps to prevent disease spread. ",
  "Cleaning removes germs, dust, dirt and impurities from surfaces. Some forms of cleaning also kill germs. Even when cleaning doesn’t kill germs, removing them from the immediate environment where people are located reduces the risk of spreading infection. ",
  "Killing germs by disinfection should be performed after cleaning to further reduce the risk of spreading infection. The coronavirus causing COVID-19 can be killed by soap, alcohol and chlorine bleach. ",
  "More specifically: SARS-CoV-2 can be neutralized by lipid solvents including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid and chloroform except for chlorhexidine. A list of disinfectants for SARS-CoV-2 can be found on the EPA’s website https://www.epa.gov/pesticideregistration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2. ",
  "Time also kills viral particles. Current information indicates that over a period of hours, low density viral particles on cardboard become inactive, and over a period of a few days, they become inactive on hard plastic and metal surfaces. However, systematic inactivation on a variety of fomites and conditions is not yet well understood. This includes its dependence on the quantity of viral deposits, temperature, humidity, and other ambient conditions. For high density or large areas, the reliability of inactivation decreases and chemical disinfection is highly recommended. Washing and the use of disinfectants also should allow time for the effects to occur. Applying disinfectant and leaving on surfaces before rinsing is important. ",

  " when available. Review appropriate methods to place and remove (don and doff) speciﬁc equipment safely. Note that the Highest risk is during removal of equipment. Reuse PPE if directed to do so. There are several disinfection methods approved by the CDC. Including UV light and Ozone. Look toward your hospital leadership and Medical Director on processes for sterilizing/disinfecting PPE for re-use. Supplies, equipment and support are on their way, if not already there. ",

  "Work/Sleep Schedules",
  "you need adequate sleep",
  "mandatory sleep and rest periods for each worker or team. The recommended strategy in this emergency scenario is a maximum 18 hours of patient care  (work), with a minimum of 12 hours of uninterrupted rest  and sequestered sleep.",
  "3) Access routes, including hallways and elevators, within the hospital are not safe spaces and require a level of protection. Having designated safe areas for staff is extremely helpful for arrival, departure and breaks. When pressure is very high the challenge of getting in and out of PPEs for drinking, eating and restroom breaks should be reduced as much as possible. ",
  "4) Appropriate procedures should be standardized for medical personnel to put on and take off their protective equipment. Separate zones should be identiﬁed. Make ﬂowcharts of different zones, provide full-length mirrors and observe the walking routes strictly. ",
  "5) We cannot have Healthcare workers being sleep deprived, immune compromised, over worked or demoralized. When these things happen, mistakes are made, needle sticks happen, dosing errors occur, people disagree and deteriorate, patient care suffers, workers become ill, workers can quickly become patients. This can lead to a complete breakdown of your local hospital system. Getting time to relax and sleep will beneﬁt you, your patients, co-workers, and anyone else inside and outside the Hospital. ",
  "6) The consecutive work time should be reduced further when there are additional staff to join the battle. For reference, anecdotally, in Wuhan when the doctors/nurses arrived from other regions, the doctors worked 8h a day and nurses 6h, because it is really exhausting and intensive. Heroic actions, while laudable, lead to higher death rates. So mandatory rest orders are essential. ",

  " At the moment, it is likely you could communicate this virus to others in your family or household group and each one of them can spread to other groups, regions and so forth. This quite easily makes all of the other methods we are using less effective at “crushing the curve”. ",

  " DO NOT return home where you would come into contact with loved ones and family members",

  "If at all possible, you should keep away from all people that are not necessary to your vital profession and position. ",
  "8) Please consider hotels, unused hospital beds/rooms, or other available lodging. If you live alone, or know someone who does, you may want to ask if you and some you work with, can stay there for some time. If you must go home, please isolate yourself from others, wear a mask, bathe with hot water and soap, and put your dirty clothes in a ziplock or trash-bag.

Examples of teams that are adapted for this crisis: Intubation teams, prone positioning teams, extra cardiac code teams. ",

  "Over the last few months, our lives have changed in many profound ways. A pick-up basketball game, a trip to the grocery store,  even walking through the lobby of our apartment building to the elevator are all fraught with potential dangers—the possibility that the forward on the other team, the last customer to squeeze the same orange, or your neighbor that pushed the elevator button are unknowingly COVID-19 positive and passing the virus onto us. This holds for everything they touch and every breath they make in the spaces we share, even momentarily. While close contacts dominate transmission, other dangers should be avoided as well. ",
  "Jogging, biking, and FaceTime get-togethers with friends are poor substitutes for that basketball game,  but they'll do in a pinch.  However, we all have to eat, and, even when we are sheltering in place, we sometimes have to leave our homes. What should be done under these circumstances? We are in a time of great fear, danger, and uncertainty. Here are a few guidelines for making our activities of daily living safer.",
  "Apartment Buildings",
  "Homes with shared entrances expose us to everyone else in our building, in the common areas, entryways, hallways, laundry rooms, sometimes even the air we breathe through a common ventilation system. ",
  "Spend as little time as possible in entryways and common areas, even when they are not crowded. The coronavirus sticks around on surfaces and in the air. ",
  "Assume any surface—your mailbox, the doorknob, elevator buttons—is contaminated and can transmit COVID-19. Put something disposable between you and the surface, gloves, a piece of cloth, or even a piece of paper. Be creative.",
  "When possible, wear a mask,* scarf or bandana when walking in shared spaces. Reusable, washable masks are available, and there are simple instructions available to make your own. ",
  "Once you get to your apartment, wash your hands well before touching anything else (with soap for at least 20 seconds). Carry hand sanitizer with you to clean your hands when you are going out. ",
  "See setting up a receiving area for packages (below).",
  "Keep windows in your apartment open when weather allows. A HEPA air purifier in your apartment will help with central ventilation systems, or when windows can't be open. ",
  "Assume elevators are contaminated, as there may be many people per day sharing that small space. Avoid sharing elevators with other people. When possible, use the stairs, it's great exercise, to boot, though still not as fun as that pick-up basketball game. ",

  "Alternative shopping solutions include, but are not limited to: online shopping, delivery apps or websites, having a friend or family member shop for you, and asking the store if they have delivery options. Delivery, family, friend or otherwise, should be done no-contact.",
  "Shopping should be done as infrequently as possible.",
  "Limit the shopping time. If possible only one member of each household should do the shopping. If the effort is too much for one person, plan the trip carefully so each one has part of the list and the shopping time is as short as possible.",
  "In order to reduce strain on the supply chain, and to make sure everyone gets the resources they need, we suggest that each individual has two weeks worth of food and goods at any point in time and we strongly discourage buying excessive amounts of any product.",
  "Before going to the store:",
  "Have a designated set of clothes and shoes that you use when shopping. Before and after shopping, launder or disinfect these clothes thoroughly, and keep them separate from your everyday clothes and shoes. ",
  "Wear gloves and a face mask (or scarf or bandana) which covers your nose and mouth.",
  "Bring your own designated shopping bags if you have them, disinfect them before and after shopping, and keep the bags away from everyday items. A rolling suitcase is a great alternative to grocery bags when walking long distances is necessary. ",
  "Hand sanitizer, sanitizing wipes, soap, or other sanitizing materials should be brought to the store, in case you or others are in need. ",
  "Make a grocery list of essential items, including amounts, before going to the store. If you know the layout of the store organize the list so that you go through the store without doubling back. If possible, include backup items in case the store is out of something specific. A well done list will make it unnecessary to call home as the use of a cell phone in the store is to be avoided.",
  "If possible, set up a receiving area in your garage, porch or entry area where you can leave non perishable items for 2-3 days, by which time any virus on the surfaces will not be active. If you have to bring them into your home, set up a marked off area for them near the entryway.",

Help those not accustomed to order online. Pay attention to what the needs are and be creative.",
  "Prioritize, with extra caution, helping senior members of the community who don't live with their children, to set up telecommunication / virtual communication, especially video. Extra caution must be taken to avoid any direct physical contact or proximity as elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable to severe disease and death.",

  "Community institutions can be creative about providing the activities remotely that are normally done in situ. For example, universities are conducting classes online. Houses of worship are streaming religious services and classes.  Book, bridge, knitting clubs meet on Zoom?",
  "As the weather for many of us warms, plan small group outdoor activities that allow participants to keep their distance (more than 6 feet) but enjoy being in the same outdoor space together.",
  "Events—birthdays and anniversaries, weddings, graduations, welcoming new babies, and deaths—times when we gather to celebrate, mourn and lend support are all changing now. The hugs will have to wait, but how can the community support celebrating together?",
  "Workplace mutual support: Some people can do their jobs from home, others cannot. In some workplaces, people with a particular job need to be present, but not all at once. i.e. medical teams, supermarkets, pharmacies, nursing homes. Work together to create a schedule that is safe, and assures that if one person or team (if that's how it is set up) does get sick, the workplace can still function. Also that no one is exhausted.",
  "Buddy pods can also work toward mutual Closed Social Circles, opening the possibility of gathering in person.",
  "Building on the Community effort, individuals and the community should seek out ways to support other communities locally, or find \"sister communities\" globally to share information with or collaborate on projects.",
  "Since the pandemic is global, this is an opportunity to meet others online from the global community, speaking another language you may be able to speak a little or not at all, to share the experience of isolation, to learn each other's language, and provide and learn safety and prevention tips from one another.

  "COVID-19 Employee Safety and Screening Questions for Employers",
  "Mar 21",
  "Employers that are striving to protect their customers and employees, especially those who are providing essential services during a lockdown, should engage with employees to determine their risks of becoming infected in order to protect them individually and collectively. This may contribute to evaluation of how to organize work spaces and identify which employees serve in roles that require contact where it is necessary. This is particularly relevant to essential services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, groceries, and health care providers as well as high risk institutions such as retirement communities, dormitories, nursing homes, rehabilitation facilities, psychiatric wards, and prisons. It is more generally relevant to any corporation that strives to protect its employees, whether they are working from home or idle until the activities are restored. ",

  "Maximize work from home to enable self-isolation and promote Safe Spaces.",
  "Maintain essential functions and reduce impact on all functions using Safe Space workspaces.",

  "Consider setting up one or more “necessities only” sections that enable a short shopping trip for most of the customers. Setting up such short shopping areas outside when weather permits, or at remote locations, can dramatically reduce the shopping density inside the store.",
  "Use floor markings or other visual system to indicate a one-way loop (with short cuts, but no back way) inside the store to promote a dominant walking direction and avoid customers crossing paths or crowding.",
  "Stores should work with their communities to make sure store visits are well spread out in time (and for community mutual help in shopping for those with symptoms or at risk). There should be a roughly constant flow of people visiting the store at any given time.",
  "Arrange the first hour for elderly or high risk customers with even lower density restrictions (even better for community mutual help to provide no-contact delivery).",
  "Customers should be reminded that they should not buy more supplies than necessary. We suggest that each individual has two weeks worth of food and goods at any point in time. ",

  "COVID-19 Recommendations for Policy Makers",
  "Mar 12",
  "I. The Challenge",
  "COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease requiring hospitalization in about 20% of cases, ICU care in 10%, and resulting in death in 2-4%. Complications rapidly increase for persons over 50 years old with comorbidities such as heart failure and coronary artery disease further increasing risk. COVID-19 can transmit even with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. ",
  "The COVID-19 outbreak has many more cases now than are visible (tip of the iceberg) and they grow rapidly: ",
  "Absent the impact of sufficiently effective intervention, the daily multiplier is 1.5 (China 01/20-01/27, South Korea 02/19-02/22, Iran 02/22-03/03, and Denmark 02/26-03/09). So if you have 100 new cases today, the number of new cases you have in one week will be 1,700, two weeks 29,000.",
  "If you act to cut the multiplier down to 1.1, then if you have 100 new cases today, the number you have in one week will be 195, two weeks 380.",
  "If you act to cut the multiplier down to 1, then if you have 100 new cases today, the number you have in one week will be 100, two weeks 100.",
  "If you act to cut the multiplier down to 0.9, then if you have 100 new cases today, the number you have in one week will be 48, two weeks 23, and you will be well on your way to stopping the outbreak.",
  "The rapid growth means that the number of cases seems unimportant until it all of a sudden overwhelms our ability to respond. This includes hospital beds and even the ability to maintain normal societal functions. ",
  "Due to the delay between transmission and symptoms, all prevention effects are postponed by around 4 days. Even if right now all citizens are encapsulated in sterile bubbles, the daily increase will still carry on for about 4 days.",
  "People are connected by an invisible transmission network whose links are the physical contacts between individuals, the breathing of common air that can contain particles that are coughed, sneezed or even just breathed out and in, as well as between individuals and physical objects that can carry viral particles deposited on them and subsequently touched by others. This transmission network is operating all the time as we engage in normal activities. It includes both work-place/professional and personal contacts with family, friends and community members. How the network is connected among individuals determines the risk that an individual will contract the disease and transmit it to others.",
  "The key to reducing the multiplier is radically pruning the network of transmission. ",
  "II. Recommended Interventions",
  "We call on government officials to take the following actions now:",
  "Limit transportation from country to country, and between parts of a country, requiring at least 14 day quarantines for those transferring from region to region. A divide and contain strategy is essential.",
  "Work with health institutions, businesses and academic institutions to rapidly ramp up mass testing to identify individuals for isolation. There are many labs in academia and companies that can perform tests and save lives. ",
  "Lockdown communities with active transmission, currently entire countries in Europe. Everyone except those providing essential services should stay home in these areas. Perform door to door search (with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)) for cases, and need for services, with community involvement. ",
  "Encourage businesses to maintain essential functions and reduce impact on all functions using Safe-Space workspaces. This includes maximizing work from home to enable self-isolation and promoting Safe Spaces for individuals and families. ",
  "Increase medical capacity by converting public and private spaces to temporary hospitals for mild and moderate symptom cases to help separate the infected individuals from the rest of the population. Expand ICU capacity as rapidly as possible.",
  "Monitor, protect and address the needs of vulnerable populations, including the homeless, and high-density facilities including prisons, nursing homes, retirement communities, dormitories, and psychiatric institutions.",
  "Carefully reexamine medical resources and estimate potential shortages in the face of exponential growth in need. Begin to mitigate those shortages now. Stockpile essential resources, repurpose businesses to produce them, prioritize the protection of medical staff.",
  "Actively cooperate with the global community on novel ways of intervention (such as South Korea's drive-through testing). This is a new and fluid situation, innovations are implemented and tested worldwide all the time.",
  "Relax rules and regulations based upon “normal” experience that don't apply to the current conditions. Be nimble and proactive instead of waiting for a perfect solution.",
  "Careful and transparent communications that promote public engagement are necessary as their active involvement in their own safety is essential. ",

  "Recognize this is not normal, normal behavior must be modified to survive, protect and sustain life. ",
  "In 80% of cases the disease is mild, 20% severe requiring hospitalization, 10% in intensive care units and 2-4% deaths. Even mild cases are contagious and can lead to severe cases for others by spreading infection, everyone has a responsibility to protect family, friends, and society from more harm. ",
  "Minimize contact, maintain essential actions and normal ones where possible, maximize help to others. ",
  "Immediate ideal response may not be possible, but every action that reduces exposure to infection reduces both your risk and the outbreak, and improvements can happen over time and through collaboration. ",
  "II. SELF-ISOLATE: ",

  "A Family Guide with Thoughts on Safe Spaces",
  "Mar 9",
  "In areas of heightened risk where government isn’t taking adequate action, protecting a family, or group, is challenging. The spread of fire requires a trail of combustibles. Similarly, the contagion of COVID-19 requires a chain of susceptible individuals. The solution is to (1) Reduce contact between the family and others, and provide for essential needs, and as the risk increases (2) Create a Safe Space that protects those who are in it by shared agreement not to be in unprotected physical contact with others or with surfaces that are touched by others. The Safe Space also curbs contagion because those in the safe space don’t participate in disease transmission. Members of one safe space can combine with others to carefully expand the safe space or create new ones. ",
  "Reducing contact between the family and others:",
  "Carefully read the guide to individuals and share it with family members. Discuss with them how to reduce their contact with others. ",
  "Shift family gatherings to virtual. The current outbreak will either be defeated or will become widespread. In the former, a few months from now will return to normal. In the latter, different actions will be needed. ",
  "Ensure that you and members of your family have necessary supplies, including prescription medicines. ",
  "Consider vulnerable members of the family including elderly, but also anybody over 50, and those with chronic health conditions, as to the risk of contact with others. Reduce their contact, provide support that enables them to stay at home and not go into public spaces. ",
  "Consider temporarily moving individuals who are in collective housing (retirement communities, assisted living facilities, etc.) to more isolated accommodations, including private homes, or small group facilities. ",
  "Where it is not possible to reduce contacts, talk with those who are responsible for collective facilities to increase the level of precautions against transmission. ",
  "Avoid public gatherings and places including events and restaurants, especially those in confined spaces. ",
  "Creating Safe Spaces under high risk conditions: ",
  "The main purpose of a safe space is for a group of people to form a solitary unit that reduces physical contacts to external individuals to a minimum while being able to self-sustain and self-support. ",
  "Individuals don’t have to wait for government-guided, top-down safety actions. In the absence of aggressive, systematic intervention, self-organized bottom-up safe-spaces also help individuals. By progressively scaling up, the safe-zones can slow or even stop local outbreaks. ",
  "Safe spaces can start from family or group of people sharing a single lodging. Multiple dwellings can be combined, including travel between them (e.g. walking or driving), if safe protocols are established and adhered to. To successfully establish a Safe Space, EVERY participant has to agree to the principles of minimizing external physical contact and adhere to it. There also have to be clear instructions about how to act and cooperate. Members of the same safe-space should be candid about travel history and health conditions, and be responsible for each other’s health.",
  "In order for individuals to commit to a shared space arrangements may need to be made with work, schools, family and friends. Staying home from work with approval of an employer, or taking a leave of absence, may be necessary.",
  "Planning an extended period of time (at least one or more weeks) in a safe space should be done in advance, including obtaining supplies, but while procuring necessities exercise extra caution given the potential exposure to crowds. Survivalist strategies may be helpful in this context. Knowing to plan ahead for necessities is critical as each trip to obtain them involves some risk.",
  "Where possible, arrange for deliveries of items, including food so that trips to the grocery store are limited. Some care must be taken as any item that is delivered had to be handled by someone. Unless there is agreement with the provider to use gloves, washing or disinfecting items is advisable in areas of active transmission. ",
  "For essential activities, including shopping, during which some external physical contact is inevitable, members should plan ahead to act efficiently and minimize the duration and extent of contact. Leaving and returning to the safe space involves precautions. Use appropriate personal protection, including gloves or disposable items (paper towels) for grabbing or manipulating items that should not be touched, sanitizer or alcohol for use on hands, and masks. Returning to the space requires washing or disinfection before (preferred) or upon entry.",
  "Promote internal communication and mutual care to keep members of the space in positive relationships and mentally healthy. Recognizing that the current emergency requires extraordinary actions and sacrifices is essential. While it may mitigate, it cannot replace the importance of mutual support.",
  "The safe space members should obtain information on the actions to be taken in case one or more members show infection symptoms. The actions vary based on countries/states/locations, and they’re also dynamic. Members should inform everyone in the group of the latest contingency plan and contact info. In case any member show typical symptoms, others should act quickly to help him/her get tested and preform precautionary isolation before results are obtained.",
  "As an outbreak progresses hard decisions will inevitably arise about whether to exit the safe space in order to help family or friends that are not in a safe space. Individuals should be prepared to make such decisions. ",
  "At a time of high risk, there will be actions taken by mistake that may compromise safety. To avoid over reaction to an individual event, it is important to realize that any single act has a low probability of harm. However, when multiple actions are taken the risk increases dramatically. Ensuring that lessons are learned is more important than accusation, blame or punishment. ",
  "Guidelines for Coronavirus in Business Settings",
  "Mar 2",
  "Executive Summary ",
  "The Coronavirus COVID-19 is a rapidly transmitting disease that evolves in 20% of cases to require extended hospitalizations and results in 2% deaths, with risks increasing rapidly for those over 50 years old. It can transmit even with mild symptoms (coughing, sneezing or elevated temperature) and perhaps before symptoms appear. Reducing the likelihood of transmission requires everyone to reduce their likelihood of contact not only so they aren’t infected but also so that they don’t transmit the disease to others. Both the direct effects on employees, and the impacts on social disruption affect business viability. ",
  "Businesses with a culture of interactions within the organization and with customers and suppliers are at great risk for contracting the disease. Supply chains can and have been disrupted. Businesses are also linked to the communities in which they are located for services. Infections in the physical neighborhood of a business location and in the neighborhoods of employees can severely disrupt the ability to conduct business. Considering a business as either being infected or not is a helpful way to think about its risk. Once an infection is present in one employee the risk to the organization increases dramatically. ",
  "Actions to be taken by a business depend on both the level of local risk and the financial impacts of performing interventions to mitigate risks. It is important to be aware of the local color coding of a zone for a particular business office or location. Green zones have no active transmission but may have a few cases that are imported from other zones. Yellow zones have a few cases of local transmission, Orange Zones have either a few clusters of cases or are adjacent to Red zones, and Red Zones have sustained community transmission. ",
  "People are connected by an invisible transmission network whose links are the physical contacts between individuals, the breathing of common air that can contain particles that are coughed, sneezed or even just breathed out and in, as well as between individuals and physical objects that can carry viral particles deposited on them and subsequently touched by others. This transmission network is operating all the time as we engage in normal activities. It includes both work-place/professional and personal contacts with family, friends and community members. How the network is connected among individuals determines the risk that an individual or an organization will contract the disease and transmit it to others. ",
  "Aggressive and bold actions are required to reduce transmission by pruning the invisible network, to reduce vulnerability and risk for individual and the organization, but also to \"get ahead\" of the outbreak so that it is stopped. Businesses have to evaluate the extent to which each action is disruptive to the business, and this should inform actions will be taken at specific risk levels. Thus, for example, in Green Zones some actions may be taken, while others may be taken in Yellow, Orange or Red Zones. ",
  "It is imperative to take actions that appear more than necessary at a particular time as a more dramatic reduction in the invisible network of transmission reduces risks to individuals and to the entire organization. Where actions taken don’t get ahead of the risk, exponential growth of a few cases results in a need for much greater actions and costs. The rapid growth makes it extremely difficult to react at the time an outbreak is spreading. Early action in a limited area of an outbreak will make it unnecessary to take more severe actions in a larger area. Early extraordinary action will prevent the need for longer term action that will ultimately be more disruptive and costly. An ounce of prevention is worth much more than a pound of cure for an exponentially growing process. ",
  "With this in mind, we present a summary of actions that businesses can take to reduce risks to everyone associated with a business and the business itself. Making essential changes may involve not just changes in individual behavior but in how business is done. \t\t \t \t \t\t",

The use of masks is debated, we note that: (1) Any individual who has even mild symptoms should avoid contact with others and should wear a mask while in necessary public or private contact with others. (2) Wearing a mask should be accepted in public settings to prevent those who are sick from hesitating to or feeling stigmatized by wearing a mask. (3) While masks do not guarantee safety for a healthy individual and their availability may be limited because of higher priority need in medical settings, using masks where proximity to others who may be infected can’t be avoided dramatically reduces the risk of infection. (4) For high risk individuals (over 50 or with preexisting health conditions) and even for low risk individuals the consequences of being infected the advantage of using a mask overrides its limitations in areas of heightened risk.

  "COVID is a tough opponent: stealthy, deceptive, fast and cruel. Lockdowns are helpful but they aren’t enough. The US case rate is still growing. Italy with a national lockdown has a very slow decline in cases. Austria is more successful, but their actions started early. Things will get worse before they get better, but we can win by anticipating it and going all out. Once we do, we can stop it in 5 weeks. After difficult losses and with important lessons learned, we can return to a normal life. Here is how.",
  "1)  Get everyone on board: All levels/aspects of government, communities, companies, individuals have to go all out to stop this disease, even small “leaks” can sink the ship. Galvanize everyone to be focused, adaptive and creative to maximize their role. This virus attacks us exponentially, but when we fight back, we do the same to the virus.",
  "2)  Lockdown: Separate individuals to prevent transmission. This is not about keeping people at home, it is about keeping people apart. Being outdoors is OK if people are separate. About 80% of transmission is within family groups. If there is a risk of infection, housemates can reduce risk by separating temporarily. The lockdown can be completed within five weeks because the exponential decline can be as fast as the exponential growth. It will be painful, but don’t fear the worst: We’ve endured the pandemic on its way up, but we can crush it on its way down.",
  "3)  Isolation: Set up facilities for mild and moderate cases so they can’t infect their housemates or others. Screen door to door to find all cases. Designate hospitals exclusive for COVID and for non-COVID to minimize collateral damage and cross-infection.",
  "4)  Wear masks in shared spaces: Coughs, sneezes, breathing out all spread the virus. Masks block transmission when people must be in the same space. Clean surfaces and use gloves or other ways to avoid touching them.",
  "5)  Travel restrictions: These will stop new outbreaks from starting, make contact tracing feasible, and preserve local achievement for a ratchet effect—maintaining forward progress by preventing backward retreat. Otherwise, it is never ending, like draining a bathtub with a running tap. Nations and states (See many country policies and US states: MA, RI, FL, TX, OH) should impose 14 day quarantines on travelers, as should separate regions within a state. Essential transportation of goods and people should follow no contact protocols into a zone or across one zone to another.",
  "6) Essential services should be safe: Companies providing essentials should develop and provide delivery, curbside pickup, or other methods to reduce risk for employees and customers.",
  "7) Testing, testing, testing: Try fighting something you can’t see. If we know who is infected we can isolate them and not everyone with cold symptoms. Individuals before and after symptoms may transmit, and testing can tell us. Tests may include genetic (PCR), CT scans, improved symptomatic screening, or others. By testing people in specific areas, we can identify those zones to focus on and those where we can relax restrictions. Note: We can’t do that if travelers can bring in the disease so this works with travel restrictions.",
  "8) Health guidelines: Focus on keeping people healthy to prevent mild cases from becoming severe. Strengthen the immune system by hydrating, eating well, sleeping, exercising, and breathing fresh or filtered air. For normal cold fevers 101° F/38° C or a bit more, let your body use the fever to fight the disease. Above 103° F/39.5° C degrees use medication to reduce fever and seek medical attention (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/ PMC4786079/).",
  "9) Support medical care: Hospitals and healthcare workers are overwhelmed and this will get worse until our actions stop the transmission. Give them the tools they need to do the best they can to save lives: facilities, medical equipment, personal protective equipment (PPEs), every- day living essentials. Recognize their achievements and show support to help them overcome ongoing challenges.",

  "During a “strong” lockdown individuals stay home except to obtain food and other essentials, access medical care, or do work essential to the functioning of society. Intercity travel within affected areas would cease. Governments would provide economic and social aid to citizens who need it.",
  "During the first two weeks of the lockdown, those who are already infected will show symptoms. This “incubation period” typically takes 3-5 days, but may take as long as two weeks. Infected individuals will recover from mild COVID- 19 cases or seek medical care. The only people who can be infected are those who are cohabitating with a previously infected individual. Since we know which individuals are infected, due to symptoms and testing, we know who can be infected and can isolate them (this is called contact tracing).",
  "During the 3-4 weeks that follow, any newly infected family or cohabitants of infected individuals will recover or seek medical attention. Once they are isolated, they cannot infect others. The number of cases will decrease rapidly. By the end of the lockdown, COVID-19 cases will be a small fraction of what they once were. This is exactly what happened in China (see figure below).",
  "The lockdown also gives time to dramatically scale up the supply of COVID-19 test kits and capacity to process them. If the number of infections is dramatically reduced using the lockdown and a massive testing regime is initiated, COVID-19 can be controlled after five weeks without extreme social distancing measures. Isolating sick individuals and their immediate contacts will be enough. This is what has been done to control the outbreak for a few cases in Singapore.",
  "The case of Italy can serve as a warning about attempting a “soft” lockdown. Italy’s lockdown measures were insuf- ficiently strict—many Italians flouted movement restrictions and continued spreading COVID-19. The disease continued to grow exponentially. Italy is strengthening its lockdown procedures to prevent further spread. Denmark, which has a more complete lockdown and closed its borders, has been much more successful at curtailing its outbreak.",

  "The Paradoxes of EndCoronavirus.org",
  "Jul 16",
  "baruch blum",
  "By Baruch M Blum",
  "We at ECV often wonder why there aren’t more people joining our efforts or following our guidelines, especially given the terrible toll that the coronavirus has already taken in the world and in so many people’s lives. This might be due in part to a few aspects of our approach that are to some extent paradoxical. You might ask, “How do you know your guidelines are right, anyway?” This brings us to the first paradox of ECV. To illustrate it, first see how you respond to these statements given your current knowledge: ",
  "Masks are an effective precaution against coronavirus: True or false? ",
  "Coronavirus is not dangerous for young, healthy people: True or false?",
  "A distance of six feet is enough to protect against the virus: True or false?",
  "Getting a haircut is safe as long as everyone is wearing a mask the whole time: True or false? ",
  "Opening schools is safe because children are not likely to spread the virus: True or false? ",
  "Being reinfected with coronavirus is very unlikely: True or false? ",
  "Getting to zero in my city would be ideal, but it is enough to flatten the curve: True or false? ",
  "Does your behavior align with your answers? ",
  "Now let’s add another option to each one: “I don’t know”. Or even, “I don’t know for sure”. For how many of them would you switch your answer to “I don’t know”? And in that case, what would it mean for your behavior to align with that answer? ",
  "Decisiveness in Uncertainty",
  "ECV advocates for very decisive action in the face of great uncertainty, and that is the first paradox. For the questions above, there is a drastic asymmetry in terms of how to act, even if the science is split or not yet known. You take the side of precaution. And in a situation with a deadly disease that spreads exponentially, you sometimes have to take that precaution with the same seriousness that you would take the most certain science. It is devastating how many lives have been lost due to people rationalizing risky behavior and policies with half-science rather than following the simple wisdom of “Better safe than sorry”. ",
  "Our situation calls for a mixture of humility and confidence that can be very tricky. You have to be humble enough to say “I don’t know” but confident enough to push yourself and others to act proactively in the face of not knowing. Unfortunately, we see many people and governments stumble in this internal conflict. On the one hand, we’ve been seeing the tragic results of overconfidence, of people thinking we could outsmart the virus without “overreacting”. On the other hand, there are those who have the humility to say “I don’t know” but who then match that humility with passivity, or just submitting to the “knowledge” of those more arrogant. ",
  "Now, you might say it’s not so simple. What about the very real costs of these precautions? Someone might be trying to outsmart the virus with some middle path, rather than go extreme, because they don’t want society to suffer from the pains of lockdown -- not just because they’re being arrogant. This speaks to the next paradox of ECV.",
  "The Question of Compassion",
  "What do you say to the parents of little kids whose school is closed because of coronavirus precautions? Or to small business owners who are going bankrupt because of lockdowns? Don’t they deserve us making an effort to compromise? The cure is not worse than the disease, but it is painful. ",
  "Unfortunately, any attempt to “compromise” with the coronavirus threatens to both prolong the pains of the cure while also perpetuating the disease. This is why ECV calls for a level of stubbornness even in the face of societal pain. To act on your compassion for those who might get sick and die, you have to push others to accept major discomforts in their lives. ",
  "Again, this is a tricky paradox. On the one hand, you of course have those who are not compassionate enough. They don’t want to accept any discomfort in their own lives, let alone going through the trouble of convincing others. But on the other hand, you have those who are very sensitive to the feelings of other people around them, and this sensitivity might keep them from pushing for sufficient precautions. Not only would they dare not tell a parent that they can’t send their kids to camp over the summer -- they might worry they’re being rude if they ask their friend to put on a mask. It would be hard to get either of these two types of people to join our efforts.",
  "And then there are people who say they would definitely want to embrace our efforts in theory, but that they don't think enough other people would opt in to make their own efforts worthwhile. Why try when the rest of society will just screw it up anyway? Which brings us to the third paradox.",
  "Optimism vs. Pessimism",
  "In our messaging, we might err on the side of pessimism about the nature of the virus itself. When the science is still so limited, pessimism about coronavirus helps motivate the proper amount of precaution. But we embrace an optimism about our agency as a society to contain it, and an optimism about the agency of a single community in changing society, and of a single individual in changing their community. ",
  "We prefer to give the benefit of the doubt to people rather than to the virus. With understanding and persistence, you can convince enough people to change their behavior, and even some politicians to change their policies. The same can't be said about the virus. Optimism about coronavirus serves no real purpose other than to allow for risky behavior. Optimism about people offers the motivation to keep pushing in the right direction. We can get to zero. ",
  "Everything's Zero-Sum until You Reach Zero",
  "Aug 2",
  "A lot of people are trying to be rational about the coronavirus. They are making cost-benefit analyses of risk in order to arrive at what they hope are responsible decisions. Some are consulting with others to offer their input. In places where case numbers have lowered and there is some reopening, you can often find people posting on Facebook asking if their friends think some activity they want to do is safe enough yet. We want to be rational and reasonable. These are qualities that are valued by much of society. ",
  "Part of the tragedy of the coronavirus crisis is that it has exploited some of the tendencies associated with rationality and reason. When you act “rationally”, you don’t let yourself be motivated by fear -- and here thousands have died because people weren’t paranoid enough. When you’re “rational”, you usually avoid being extreme -- and it is extreme measures which we need, and which we needed at the outset. When you’re “rational”, you gather information and make a knowledge-based decision -- but in our attempts to look to our limited knowledge about the virus, we have at many points failed to reckon with the enormity of our ignorance. ",
  "But rationalizing is a sticky habit. And in our desires to get back to normal, many of us are falling back on the self-assurance of personal reasoning, despite the tragic failure of much of our reasoning throughout this crisis. One variable which is particularly susceptible to misuse in our determinations is the number of cases in our respective cities or states. In places where the number of cases has fortunately been reduced, there is unfortunately a strong tendency for everyone to relax their precautions, often with the rationale of a cost-benefit risk analysis. A low number of cases fits neatly into an individualized risk analysis telling us that our risk of exposure is low, so that we can change our behavior accordingly. ",
  "But if we consider things on the community level, then the logic starts to break down. We can’t all assume that we’re probably not interacting with someone who has coronavirus, because until the number of cases is zero, some of us are in fact interacting with infected and contagious people. And some of us are infected and contagious without knowing it. ",
  "Many people who insist that their precautions are sufficient would admit that they would behave differently if they knew for certain that they themselves or the people with which they interact were infected with coronavirus. Of course, to an extent, it makes sense that we behave differently in a realm of probability from how we behave in a case of certainty. But we have to acknowledge that these are compromises in a state of emergency, and that as long as we’re operating in this realm of probability with the coronavirus, any compromise is a zero-sum game. ",
  "That means that until you’ve reached zero in a green zone, nothing “becomes safe again” just because the numbers have dropped. The standard still has to be to treat everyone outside your bubble as if they have coronavirus. Any behavior outside of this standard is taking advantage of the limited room for compromise that we have collectively. ",
  "Arguments can be made about what is essential enough to allow for an exception. You can argue that someone suffering from loneliness should allow themselves to socialize in person even if their friends aren’t the best mask wearers. You can argue that someone struggling to feed their family is justified going along with their boss’ insistence that they return to the office instead of working from home, just so that they can keep their job. But we have to realize that we are making exceptions where limited exceptions can be made, and that you shouldn’t change the standards to fit the exceptions. ",
  "Arguing that social distancing should be relaxed because some people are suffering from severe loneliness is like arguing that we should raise the speed limit because ambulances have to drive faster sometimes. The fact is, any general relaxing of standards makes it less safe for individuals to allow themselves certain exceptions in extreme situations. It makes no sense for us to lower our own precautions as if in solidarity with those who are suffering most from precautionary measures. (And as for those of us doing things like getting haircuts and feeling okay about it because we’re supporting our barber, we should realize that we can always send the money as a gift or get a giftcard if that’s available.)",
  "Until you’re in a green zone, you’re in a state of emergency, and everything’s zero-sum until you reach zero. It’s a difficult reality to be in, and we should all be understanding of one another. But we can’t let our own standards or the standards of our community slip, lest we undo whatever containment we’ve achieved. ",

  "There is tiredness and resentment of hearing about the virus. The virus is not slowed by fatigue nor by resentment. Wishful thinking also does not arrest viral spread. Epidemics are stopped by cutting susceptibility and by blocking transmission. Possibly you've been told susceptibility can be reduced by reaching “herd immunity”. Maybe that's what your community is trying for -or hoping for- without explicit acknowledgment. Or your community's plan is to wait for a vaccine, or to pretend that the pandemic is not here.

  "Every Choice Counts",

  "|I know everyone is “done with this pandemic”. Really, I am too! After weeks turn into months, it’s wearing us down. We may find ourselves relaxing our COVID precautions.  Who hasn’t thought \"I won’t get it” or \"if I do, it won’t be bad\"?  By now we have all slipped up; relaxed our precautions. What I want to emphasize here is the danger of normalizing those slip-ups. It’s human tendency to conclude a sense of false safety in these situations, when nothing bad happens immediately after we break a rule. For example, after we do slip up and forget our mask, and we don’t fall ill we may start to think, “oh, it’s not that contagious…” and then wear our mask less and less. This rationalization and subsequent behavior change not only is fooling us, it’s putting others and ourselves at risk. It’s prolonging pandemic life, the very thing we want to be done with. Eventually, those slip ups will result in virus spread and pandemic life won’t ever end.",
  "So remember, every choice counts! Every time we wear a mask, every meal we cook at home, every invitation we decline, every trip we postpone, it is making a difference. Just like a diet, when we slip up for a day, it doesn’t mean we should blow the week or give up all together. Dust yourself off, and get back to being vigilant.Together, with each smart choice we make, we will keep ourselves safe and influence those around us to be safe too. Let’s get to zero together.",

  "Oct 31",
  "Friday, October 30, 2020",
  "by Joaquin Beltran",
  "This is the most unique election in our lifetimes  ",
  "Here is why",
  "In the United States alone, almost a quarter million people have died of COVID and we are nearing 10,000,000 cases. We have recently broken records for daily new cases and every day the numbers are growing quickly. People have lost loved ones, often without being in the same room with them because the disease is so contagious. People have lost their jobs while small businesses have closed, people are being evicted from their homes, and many who have contracted COVID are left to deal with the lingering long-term effects of the damage it has done to their body. The amount of health and economic struggles experienced by so many Americans at this moment has not been felt at this scale in most of our lifetimes. Yet, with all these challenges -and largely motivated by them- Americans are voting in record numbers before Election Day. ",
  "Many people are fired up, passionate, and ready to make their voices heard yet half of eligible voters actually vote in presidential elections. ",
  "Why is that? ",
  "There are challenges that are clearly systemic and that create more barriers than should exist like voter registration and complicated voting laws that disenfranchise many voters, and this is something that government reform activists are continuing to work on to be more democratic and accessible. There is also a human experience element to the level of civic engagement in our country. During some elections the choice is easy; we find candidates that align with our values, they say the things we believe in, and have a track record that shows their integrity. There are other times when it is much more difficult, you'll hear ideas or, maybe you've even said things like, \"we are choosing the lesser of two evils,\" \"my vote doesn't matter,\" or \"they're all the same.\" ",
  "Getting involved is the leap of faith that shows you that change is possible. ",
  "For every person, the election is different and they view it differently because of their experiences in life, their experiences with the government, what they watch on the news, or what they're hearing from their friends. And it's hard to say to those people that they're wrong because there may be legitimate reasons why they feel that way. I too have experienced those feelings before I became involved in my community and politics, and completely understand the legitimacy of that perspective. But I will tell you that getting involved is the leap of faith that shows you that change is possible. Getting involved shows you that you can influence the challenges and opportunities in your life, in your community, and for those that will come after us. Voting is the simplest and most effective act we can do to accelerate change. The outcomes aren't always linear, and sometimes it feels like we take two steps forward and one step back, but if we keep taking action and making our voices heard, we keep getting closer to a better world.",

I had suffered from shingles 10 years earlier, and the fact that my resistance was so low that it could break through again triggered alarm bells for me. I started Googling for rashes with covid-19 infection and soon found out that this was more common. However, the RIVM did not report this as a symptom that occurs when infected with the Coronavirus. I called the doctor with this information, but unfortunately, this was not yet known to them, and they did not want to link the two. After getting a diagnosis of my symptoms through photos on Whatsapp, I was prescribed a course of antibiotics and ointment. You know, the type of antibiotics that helps your body clear up a bacterial infection, but which should not be prescribed for a viral infection, because it can make the symptoms worse. I decided, of my own accord, to go into quarantine.",

The rash made my torso feel like it was full of tiny splinters, which were sometimes itchy and then burned again. It got to a point where part of my body was itchy in the evening, a few hours later an open sore appeared on that spot, which was gone by the next morning. At the same time, my lungs started to protest and my chest and back started to tighten. When I just got sick I did suffer from a cold-like symptoms; I sneezed often and was very snotty, but I didn't cough excessively, so the pain in my lungs came as an unpleasant surprise. I soon couldn't sit or lie down, and walking became more and more difficult because of the constant pain and sharp jabs in my lungs.  The shortness of breath made it harder and harder to breathe, and soon it hurt to simply inhale. In these weeks I called the doctor and emergency post several times, but as long as I could still speak a full sentence, there was nothing they could do for me. \"Call us back if you are fully out of breath.\"",
  "\"Call us back if you are fully out of breath\"",
  "After the antibiotic treatment (that didn’t work), I got prescribed stronger ointments to heal the skin, but nothing seemed to work. The pain in my lungs got worse and I also had sharp jabs in my chest every now and then. Eventually, I was able to go to the GP practice after 2.5 months because I no longer had flu-like symptoms. In those 2,5 months they had seen several confirmed corona patients with the same atypical rash. This, in combination with all my other symptoms, made them almost certain that I also had a covid infection. They listened to my heart and lungs and noticed an accumulation of fluid in my lungs and an abnormal heart rhythm; every time faster, and then suddenly slower. My blood pressure seemed fine, so the advice was to ‘rest up’. Two days later my legs gave out and I collapsed. I got palpitations and started hyperventilating. Now, gasping for air, I called the emergency post; I had to come straight to the COVID emergency clinic. Once there, they checked my resting heart rate (fine) and saturation (also fine). There seemed to be nothing wrong with me, although I did have pain everywhere. Yet they did not want to test me for coronavirus, because I still did not have a vital profession. So I was sent back home. As a precaution, I decided to buy a pulse/ oximeter, so that I could keep track of my values myself. It soon became apparent that even when walking small distances my saturation fluctuates, sometimes even between 80 and 97 (normal is 95-100). My heart rate while resting was often 130-140, but would sometimes drop to 45 when walking or doing chores.",
  "1 June",
  "At the beginning of June, everyone in the Netherlands with complaints could finally get tested, or so they said. On June 1, I called 8 times for an appointment, but without success. The Corona hotline was down. Finally, I managed to make an appointment on June 3. GGD Haaglanden told me that Test location Westeinde, in The Hague was already full for the rest of the month. The nearest location, Leidschendam-Voorburg, would open in a week. I don't have a car, so I was advised to come to Nootdorp by public transport. When I pointed out that this is very unwise advice for someone potentially infected with the coronavirus, I was told to come by bike. This while I could hardly walk, let alone cycle, for months. Anyway, 4 hours later (and due to the corona hotline being incorrectly connected to both the Haaglanden Safety Region, the Haaglanden fire brigade, and 112 operators) it turned out that transport could indeed be arranged if there was no other option. Victory!",
  "The test result is negative!?",
  "I got the results 3 days later: negative. It made me doubt whether or not I even had covid, but my doctor immediately told me that this result was logical given that I was tested far too late. To be on the safe side, she wanted me to do an antibody test. The message was: 'Do it quickly, the RIVM has just received a message that they want to scale down the administration of antibody tests'. This was on Friday afternoon. I quickly made the appointment and received confirmation that I could come to the test location of the Ado stadium. That Saturday, I was physically in bad shape and going to the test site meant a 40-minute walk from the station to the testing site and back. I decided to get some rest and go that Sunday. Once I arrived at the testing site it looked deserted. 'Am I in the right location? Are they closed?' According to the only available website, the Ado stadium testing location would be open 7 days a week. There was no overview of all the test locations posted on the RIVM or government’s website. GGD Haaglanden, who are in charge of testing in my area, was also not reachable by phone on Sundays and the call center operators at the corona hotline weren’t even aware of the test location’s existence.There I was, at a closed test location, after I had to gather all the strength I had to get there in the first place. It enraged me that the system was so badly set up and caused me, and many other sick people, to get into situations like this. It was a war of attrition, and recovering from this whole debacle took me 3 days. The following week some guidelines were changed and it was made possible to get tested for antibodies in the hospital. After 3.5 months, I was finally allowed to have myself tested for antibodies in a crowded hospital, with more than 40 people in the waiting room and where no one was wearing a mask. Also negative. Did I not have covid19 after all? It soon became apparent that not everyone produces antibodies when going through the virus and that ",
  ". Therefore, an antibody test is also not reliable if it is performed after such a long time. My doctor had been convinced that I had Covid for a long time, but for follow-up research, those 2 negative tests make it more difficult to get the right care. However, thousands, if not",

  "After months of going through the illness at home, I am now finally doing all kinds of physical examinations: X-rays of the lungs (chest), a heart film (ECG), a bicycle test, and a lung function test. There are always several weeks between each examination. It soon became painfully clear that the examination process for people with long-term complaints is too long and needs optimization. For example, it took more than 3.5 months before the first examinations were done. In research into long-term symptoms after Covid (#longcovid), the focus is also mainly on the lungs, while many people, including me, have",

  "Now, after 6 months, I am so tired of being sick. I often hear others say things like how they’re 'sick and tired of corona' when they talk about the consequences of this corona crisis. I too am sick and tired of COVID, but in a completely different way. I am still exhausted day in day out, have difficulties with almost all physical activities and can only walk for about 15 minutes without pain. Furthermore, I still suffer from: headaches, loss of strength in limbs, loss of feeling in arm/leg, inflammation throughout my body, 'brain fog' and I have trouble finding words and following conversations. It's like your body just isn't working properly anymore, in every possible way.  My heart also appears to be affected, which causes palpitations and jabs in my chest and upper back every day. I’ve been prescribed heart medication to keep my heart rhythm steady while I wait for a follow-up examination with the cardiologist. However, it has become clear over the last couple of days that I won’t be able to get any care in the next couple of months, because Dutch hospitals are filling up quickly with covid-patients, and regular care is already being scaled down. As I am writing this we have had a record amount of cases for a week straight, and the extra safety measures that are being taken will probably not be enough to limit the spread at this point. Furthermore, RIVM is still denying the effectiveness of facemasks. Even healthcare workers in hospitals do not wear facemasks, hereby making hospitals possibly the worst place to be right now. The result of all this: The hospital I’ve been referred to for my next examination just reported an outbreak at the cardiology department. This is one of many ",

This was compounded by my frequent loss of memory and concentration, which makes writing for a long amount of time very difficult. Nevertheless, I hope that this contribution will be of help to other people with post-covid syndrome. I would like to wish everyone who finds themselves in the same situation a full and speedy recovery and a lot of strength. Would you like to get in touch with fellow long Covid sufferers?

  "Fatigue",
  "COVID fatigue, or pandemic fatigue, is the idea that over time, people are less inclined to take",
  "precautions to protect themselves and their community. This occurs for a multitude of reasons.",
  "The first is the idea of an invisible risk. At the beginning of the virus, it was easy to act",

  "Eliminating COVID-19: Whenever We’re Ready",
  "Sep 22",
  "By: Blake Elias",
  "The most striking thing about COVID-19 is that six plus months since reaching US shores, it is still rampant within our borders — when we could eliminate it within 5 weeks if we took correct actions.",
  "This is a serious enough threat to public health, the economy, and national security, that there’s a significant up-side to full containment — as we’ve done for other pandemic threats (e.g. Ebola, SARS).",
  "At times, we’ve gone 90% of the way to elimination — but then we give up effort and let resurgences continue. Restaurants want to re-open. Consumers want their usual lifestyle back. Parents want to send their kids back to school.",
  "These are all justifiable things to want. But by re-opening too early, we’re only screwing ourselves over, by keeping the problem around for longer.",
  "And by pinning all hopes on a vaccine, we’re paying a real price today for some magic pill that will come… some day, maybe?",
  "A Way Out",
  "We should realize that it is feasible to eliminate COVID from any region within a 5–6 week period. One way to do this, beyond a typical “lock-down”, is a fully strict stay-at-home order. If a region agreed to do a 100% shelter-in-place strategy for 5 weeks (picture stocking up on 5 weeks worth of food, and then not going out for any reason for the next 5 weeks), then COVID would be eradicated from that region.",
  "Of course, such an extreme strategy is not necessary. I mention it simply to prove that full eradication is physically possible. Once we realize this, we can investigate “smarter” ways to accomplish this, with more moderate measures, while still ensuring full elimination. See ",
  " for more details.",
  "All that matters is a region achieves full elimination. Because once they do, they can fully re-open with no more restrictions needed. They would just have to regulate travel from regions that still have COVID (i.e. mandatory 14-day isolation, with steep fines for non-compliance). But besides this, they could enjoy un-restricted travel to/from other COVID-free regions.",
  "This would be an extremely quick, cheap, and relatively painless process, compared to the months, and likely years, of drawn out pain and worry that we are set to go through otherwise.",
  "Cost vs. Benefit",
  "Would there be some inconvenience? Yes. This would require a far stricter lock-down than most of us are used to.",
  "There would also be a direct financial cost: we would have to pay people to stay home for those 5 weeks, since we’re asking them to sacrifice their job. Imagine paying the 300 million US citizens, $1000 / week for 5 weeks. This comes out to $5000 * 300 million = $1.5 trillion. This is far cheaper than the $6 trillion and counting that we’ve already spent on stimulus bills, extended un-employment pay-outs, etc. — not to mention the long-term economic trouble that’s still to come, via inflation, debt, unemployment, and general economic slow-down.",
  "Besides the financial cost, this would also be a notable lifestyle disruption. Many would complain — indeed, some regions would opt-out (and would be excluded from travel when everyone else re-opens).",
  "But we must understand, that for the luxury of avoiding this “inconvenience”, we’re paying dearly:",
  "A global recession that will last years — perhaps a decade before full recovery",
  "Millions dead around the world",
  "Masks and distancing indefinitely — likely several more years",
  "Heated conflict over elections, back-to-school, sports, etc.",

  "A general state of “fear, uncertainty and doubt”",
  "This will all last several more years. Was this all worth it, just to avoid the boredom and confinement of staying home for 5 weeks? (I know… no dine-out restaurants… the horror!)",
  "Short-Term Pain = Long-Term Gain",
  "The trade-off above is similar to the pain of receiving a vaccine. Most people hate needles — there will be a few seconds of pain as you receive the injection. But we’re prepared to accept that pain, due to the long-term relief that vaccination will bring.",
  "In the same way, the short-term pain for 5 weeks of strict lock-down, would be more than worth it for the long-term relief we’d get from solving COVID once and for all.",

  "  9/11: Lessons for Today  ",
  "Sep 30",
  "I’m always looking for an issue to organize my community around. What is the most pressing issue right now and what can I do to create solutions. Most importantly, who can I bring onboard to said issue to help bring about change? Last year, I felt that being involved in a presidential campaign was the best thing I could do at that moment to help bring about change. We need new ideas! New bold leadership to present those ideas. Presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg's message of Freedom, Security, Democracy stuck with me! “I’m all onboard!” I said to myself. \"I will go to vulnerable communities and discuss what those three words meant in their lives. How can we make sure everyone is free and secure in this democracy?\" I stomped through rural and urban towns and cities. I drove across the state of South Carolina and sometimes flew to meet my candidate at events to represent the campaign and to help deliver and develop the campaign’s platform with black and brown communities. ",
  "As soon as the primaries were over for my candidate, the pandemic was settling in in our country. People were still traveling. I was too. But then there was an abrupt stop to life as we knew it. Suddenly, the organizing stopped. The surviving campaigns didn’t know what to do. Every community organizer and political operative I knew was in a state of bewilderment. The question wasn’t how do we organize now. It was how do we survive now? I immediately thought, there is no surviving without organizing around the pandemic. ",
  "My major concern was how the pandemic was raging through the black community. With pre-existing health conditions tied to systemic racism, I knew that Covid-19 would only make it worse. I also thought of the issues we face now such as elections and the census and how these democratic actions will be severely affected by Covid-19. I knew that tools vital to our democracy such as choice and representation would be altered if we didn’t find a way to organize during the pandemic. ",
  "I was frustrated. I knew what I needed to do but I didn’t know where to start. Alas! I received a call from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). They said that they needed community leaders to get this Covid-19 information to the black community and asked me to be a part of their Environmental Justice Covid-19 Committee. Emphatically, I said “Yes!”",
  "I immediately started throwing ideas at them. Social distancing challenges. Religious messaging to the black church and none of those suggestions were acknowledged. I then realized that they just wanted me and others on the committee to send Covid-19 safety educational materials to our networks. I did just that. I emailed the flyers and distributed them at protests, as well as sharing it on social media. But nope. Though it was great work. I didn’t feel like it was enough for me. More needed to be done and I needed support. ",
  "A friend of mine, Chris Richardson called me and connected me to his former colleague US Diplomat, Ben Lazarus. He was reaching out because he needed to connect with advocates on the ground. My friend referred him to me because I was on the DHEC Environmental Justice Covid-19 Committee. He offered End Coronavirus to me and it was exactly what I was looking for without me knowing what to look for. Having experts guiding our organizing efforts has helped us with partnerships with government entities, organizations, and community leaders. Organizing volunteers around an unknown situation was and continues to be a challenge. Participants have competing priorities which hinders consistent participation. However, being in a state where there's a huge vulnerable population, you must be patient. The progress has been slow but steady and we could not be here without the amazing work from my team in South Carolina who are all dedicated and committed to this project. I could not do this without them. ",
  "Throughout the spring and summer, the advice that our team and the community has received is incomparable. Government agencies we usually rely on are inconsistent and not unforthcoming about Covid-19 data and information for various reasons. Organizations, elected officials and restaurant owners have all expressed their gratitude for having science-based information from ECV. I am glad that the campaigns, supporting organizations, and the community finally found a way to organize around elections digitally. While I am assisting them, I decided most of my efforts would be centered around organizing communities to fight against Covid-19. In doing so, I am in the fight for life, liberty and the pursuit of democracy. ",

  "There are many ways in which sports, professional sports in particular, are a somewhat distorted microcosm of US life and culture. Like the rest of US society, sports leagues struggle with revenue and safety considerations in setting their standards for reopening. Teams cannot practice remotely, and games require travel.  Social distancing is not possible in professional sports, nor is it possible to avoid heavy breathing, known to increase risk of transmission. Masks during practice and games are not feasible, and would not solve the transmission problem with such close contact. ",
  "As players tested positive, seasons were suspended and shortened Sports associations and the parallel players’ associations developed plans to bring sports to their fans in need of a fun activity, while maintaining safety of their players and continued revenue stream. Some plans were more successful than others; they continue to evolve.",
  "Players play in empty arenas and stadia, considerably mitigating risk but also reducing the revenue, value and fun. ",
  "NBA and NHL created “bubbles” for their players with strict rules for separation from family and community, frequent COVID testing, ongoing measurement of relevant vital signs, contact tracing, distancing and masks off the court,. All 22 basketball teams are sequestered together in Disney World, under the same roof(s), rules and conditions for the duration of the shortened season. NHL arranged for two bubbles, in Toronto and Edmonton, Canada, with travel only between those bubbles for games. ",
  "The Leagues, players’ associations, medical experts and relevant government officials came together to discuss, argue, discuss some more, decide and together own the plans and their execution. The plans include many, many details: food (professional athletes in season require A LOT of food and a well balanced healthy diet), safe, distanced entertainment and social activities, medical care, laundry, religious services, etc.",
  "The COVID 19+ track record of both basketball and hockey is quite good. They have gotten to zero.  Players feel safe and, within the bubble, they experience some semblance of normal. The next phase in NBA’s “opening up” is bringing family members safely into the bubble. This, too, involves isolation, testing, and strict rules. ",
  "In summary, sports bubbles: ",
  "are community wide efforts requiring agreement, participation and ownership of everyone involved; ",
  "require strict measures;",
  "must include isolation and quarantine spaces if someone tests positive;",
  "use advanced technology, frequent testing of multiple types, contact tracing and isolation/quarantine; ",
  "must provide all services needed by the community;",
  "are expensive, but not as expensive as cancelling sports seasons completely. ",
  "“Bubble” is sports language for “",
  ".” Let’s imagine for a moment, what it would look like to expand the Disney World or Edmonton bubble. NBA is taking the first step by making it possible for family members to join. Perhaps this involves additional hotels within Disney, or a hotel that is associated with Sea World or Universal Studios, also in the Orlando area.  Travel and contact between facilities in the bubble is allowed. ",
  "Next, imagine expanding to one or two communities where Disney/Sea World/Universal employees live with their families. What is involved in making them a part of the bubble or green zone? ",
  "Community involvement in and ownership of its plan to join the bubble, including following all of the rules of the bubble. ",
  "Daily or twice daily temperature and symptom checks (there’s an app, or two or three, for that) reported to a central location;",
  "Check in phone calls, texts, and safe (masked, distanced, brief) visits, organized through religious communities, scout groups, service organizations to assure that vulnerable community members have what they need.",
  "Hotel space at Disney/Sea World/Universal Studios for those who need to isolate and quarantine to keep household members safe, costs covered by Disney, NBA, the city. ",
  "Shopping and other services within the green zone could be carried out normally. Grocery stores and pharmacies outside the bubble require delivery or curb side pick up;",
  "Travel freely within green zones, no-contact travel through red or yellow zones until they too are green;",
  "Once the towns where hotel and other staff live are green the schools and other stores, services, agencies can open, slowly and carefully. ",
  "None of this is easy or cheap, it wasn’t easy or cheap for NHL or NBA or its players and team staff.  But the business and financial leaders of each team, the league and the players ran the numbers in multiple ways and determined that it was better than the alternative – no season at all for at least 2019-2020, possibly longer.  Creating successful community green zones is, of course, not nearly as costly or elaborate as renting Disney for the entire NBA. And communities will take advantage of lessons learned in Orlando, Edmonton and Toronto. However, like professional sports leagues, the financial and human resources invested in creating, expanding and linking green zones will repay themselves many times over in full economic, educational and cultural activity, lives saved, safety, short and long term health costs. ",
  "One more thing: let’s imagine that, after the Stanley Cup and NBA championships, teams return home to their friends, neighbors and fans; home to communities with several hundred to several thousand new COVID 19 cases ",

It was a moment, a period of unspeakable tragedy, of fear, of confusion. Three thousand people died on that day from all walks of life and first responders who ran in to help those in danger. Military actions that continue to today have cost countless more deaths, limbs, lives forever changed. We live with its repercussions now, 19 years later, in our economy, our travel, our sense of safety and security. ",
  "In the period following 9/11, there was an outpouring of grief, pain, unity and action from people from all over the US and the world.

Heightened security in airports, places of large gatherings, and other high visibility and traffic spaces and events remain with us. Our children don’t know any other way. ",

  "This is a time for us as a nation and a world to come together to face a common enemy, a common threat. That is the only way to defeat it. Until we are all safe, none of us is safe. ",
  "After 9/11 the best military, intelligence and security minds worked together to address the threat. They succeeded, and their work continues. This is not an oxymoron. Success means ongoing vigilance and research to develop new knowledge, new tools. COVID 19 requires the ongoing vigilance of communities to stop its spread, ongoing research to treat this disease, to mitigate its severity, to address the long term consequences that we see among those of all ages and severities of the original COVID 19. ",
  "When travel was stopped and slowed after 9/11, people grumbled, but they understood and complied. We were in this together. The economy took a hit, but recovered. We can grumble about COVID 19 travel restrictions and lockdowns too, and we must comply. We are in this together.  If the government does not shut down travel, schools and business for our safety, we must take ownership of our own safety personally and in our communities. As in 2001, the economy will recover when we are safe again. ",
  "“If you see something say something” has become a part of our every day parlance since 2001. Security cannot only be in the hands of professionals. We are all responsible to be aware and to care for ourselves and for one another. Now we talk about “the new normal.” This new normal is still evolving, but it is clear that maintaining our safety and health requires all of our care and participation, now and in the future. ",
  "It is an honor to the memories and forever changed lives brought about by 9/11 to apply lessons learned to the threat we face today. We are in this together. No one is safe, physically or economically, until we are all safe. ",

  "We are all waiting and hoping for a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19. With many vaccines currently in clinical trials, it is very likely that we will find one that works well. Unfortunately, it will likely be several more months before we have a licensed vaccine and well into 2021 before we’re able to distribute enough vaccine to make a difference in the pandemic. However,  a vaccine is but one tool that we can use to eliminate COVID-19. Our public health interventions (e.g. testing, contact tracing, lockdowns and travel restrictions) and our individual actions (e.g. face coverings, physical distancing and hand washing) can be just as effective as a vaccine (if not more so) and we don’t need to wait to implement them. ",
  "A vaccine can be a powerful tool, but it will not work in exclusion of personal actions and public health interventions. We already know the actions necessary to eliminate COVID-19 and we already know they work. If we act now, and act together, we can stop community transmission of COVID-19 in just ",

  "I started volunteering with EndCoronavirus (ECV) in March after realizing that I needed to do my part to get my life back to normal. Before COVID19 was considered a global pandemic, I wasn't concerned, and I felt that life would go on as planned. I was going to celebrate a milestone birthday with my friends and family at the end of March. My husband and I had planned a vacation we had been looking forward to and saving for years. After realizing that things were getting worse, particularly in the US, I learned that my plans would have to be put on hold. I felt like 2020 was having to be postponed to an unknown time in the distant future. I don't know when my life will go back to normal as I used to know it.",
  "Knowing all this though, I refuse to believe that is this is my new normal now and just the way life is going to be for a while. I want to visit my family and friends. I want to go out to dinner and a movie with my husband without thinking about our potential exposure to a deadly virus. That's why I wear a mask. That's why I limit my contact with everyone, including the loved ones I miss dearly. That's why I work with ECV to spread the word about the ways we can END COVID19, such as widespread testing, extensive contract tracing, and strict travel restrictions. I won't just accept that is it here to stay and we have to live like this. I want to go back to the normal I knew before the pandemic. I believe it's possible.",

  "Wow, how our world has changed",
  "by  Joaquín Beltrán",
  "There are times in the middle of the day when I’m doing some work and this recurring thought visits me, “wow, how our world has changed…” I think about this when I think about the times I could be in the same room with my friends and family who I haven’t seen in months. I think about this when I hear about friends who have lost loved ones, some who have lost both parents because of COVID and are expected to stay strong and move forward. I think about this when my friends who work at hospitals tell me that stroke victims aren’t coming in because they fear exposure to COVID and never get the immediate treatment that would have reversed the damage. I think about this when I see local businesses shutting down and hear of people in our communities who are facing eviction. I think about this when I remember all the coffee shops and restaurants I would visit multiple times a week and the fact that I haven’t been to one for the last six months.",
  "In many ways, I think about how good we used to have it; to be able to enjoy each other’s company, hug each other, dance, sing out loud, make new friends, all without having the fear that we could be carrying the virus or that if we caught it from someone that we could pass it onto the people in our lives. This new world is not necessary, in fact, a world where we can shake hands, give big hugs, or just be in the same room with each other with very little risk of transmission is very possible and we can get there very soon. The reality is that it is much easier to end the pandemic in a few weeks, than it is to try and live with it for countless more months… potentially years. We know what works to prevent transmission: wearing masks, contact tracing, isolating the sick, accurate testing with quick results, and quarantining travelers from outbreak areas are necessary to make this happen quickly and we need everyone on board to do it.",
  "Let’s do all we can to end this pandemic. If you’re already doing that, thank you, and if you can do more, let’s start today. Hope to see you all soon and share in some celebratory hugs. \t",
